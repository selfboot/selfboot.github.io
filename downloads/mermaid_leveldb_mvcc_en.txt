    Note over DB: Store (A, seq=100) = 1

    Note over R1: Can see data with seq<=101

    Note over DB: Store (A, seq=102) = 3

    Note over R2: Can see data with seq<=102
    
    R1->>DB: Read key=A
    DB-->>R1: Return value=2 (seq=101)
    
    R2->>DB: Read key=A

    Note over DB: Different snapshots can read different versions of the same key concurrently
