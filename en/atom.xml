      <description>Using LevelDB&#39;s hash table implementation as an example, this article analyzes how to design a high-performance hash table. Through double pointers, it implements linked list insertion, deletion, and lookup operations, optimizes list insertion using head insertion method, and analyzes the implementation of list expansion. Finally, it provides a detailed introduction to double pointers in C++ through an example.</description>
      
      
      
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hash tables are a classic data structure that anyone who has written code should be familiar with. Every programming language has its own hash table implementation that’s ready to use out of the box. As a result, while many people have used hash tables, probably not many have implemented one themselves.</p><p>Designing a high-performance hash table actually requires considering quite a few details, such as how to handle hash collisions and how to handle hash table expansion. Some mature hash table implementations, like the one in the C++ standard library, have a large <a href="https://github.com/gcc-mirror/gcc/blob/master/libstdc%2B%2B-v3/include/tr1/hashtable.h">codebase</a> and can be difficult to understand.</p><p>Fortunately, when implementing LRU Cache, LevelDB also implemented a <a href="https://github.com/google/leveldb/blob/main/util/cache.cc#L70">simple and efficient hash table</a>. The overall code is very concise - small but complete, making it very worth studying. Using LevelDB’s hash table implementation as an example, this article analyzes how to design a high-performance hash table.</p><span id="more"></span><h2 id="Why-LevelDB-Implements-Its-Own-Hash-Table"><a href="#Why-LevelDB-Implements-Its-Own-Hash-Table" class="headerlink" title="Why LevelDB Implements Its Own Hash Table"></a>Why LevelDB Implements Its Own Hash Table</h2><p>The C++ standard library already has a hash table implementation, so why did LevelDB implement its own? Here’s what the official documentation says:</p><blockquote><p>We provide our own simple hash table since it removes a whole bunch<br>of porting hacks and is also faster than some of the built-in hash<br>table implementations in some of the compiler&#x2F;runtime combinations<br>we have tested.  E.g., readrandom speeds up by ~5% over the g++<br>4.4.3’s builtin hashtable.</p></blockquote><p>To summarize, other implementations can be cumbersome, while implementing their own version eliminates third-party dependencies and ensures both code simplicity and performance.</p><h2 id="LevelDB-Hash-Table-Implementation-Principles"><a href="#LevelDB-Hash-Table-Implementation-Principles" class="headerlink" title="LevelDB Hash Table Implementation Principles"></a>LevelDB Hash Table Implementation Principles</h2><p>The hash table implementation here is similar to the one in the C++ standard library, using an array to store hash buckets. <strong>The average time complexity for insertion, lookup, and deletion operations is O(1) - first locate the specific hash bucket based on the key’s hash value, then perform the corresponding operation on the collision chain</strong>. Additionally, if the hash table’s load factor becomes too high during insertion, expansion occurs.</p><p>One thing to note is that since LevelDB’s hash table is used to implement LRU Cache, the element type here is <code>LRUHandle</code>. Besides having key and value fields, it also has a next_hash pointer that uses chaining to handle hash collisions. Additionally, it stores the hash value, which is typically generated by the caller and saved. This allows the hash value to be used directly in subsequent lookup, insertion, and deletion operations to locate the specific hash bucket. The other fields of LRUHandle are mainly used in LRU Cache and won’t be discussed here.</p><h3 id="FindPointer-Implementation"><a href="#FindPointer-Implementation" class="headerlink" title="FindPointer Implementation"></a>FindPointer Implementation</h3><p>Let’s first look at the operation to find a specified key. LevelDB encapsulates a basic <code>FindPointer()</code> method that returns a double pointer to the key. Here’s the <a href="https://github.com/google/leveldb/blob/main/util/cache.cc#L115">specific implementation</a>:</p><figure class="highlight cpp"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="comment">// Return a pointer to slot that points to a cache entry that</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="comment">// matches key/hash.

If the bucket is empty, it directly returns the address pointing to the bucket’s nullptr head pointer. If the bucket is not empty, <strong>it uses the classic chaining method to handle hash collisions</strong>. It traverses the collision chain on the hash bucket, and if it finds the corresponding key, it returns a double pointer pointing to that node. If it traverses the entire list without finding it, it returns the address of the tail pointer.</p><p>The clever part here is that <strong>it returns a double pointer, allowing the method to be reused in lookup, insertion, and deletion operations</strong>. During lookup, directly dereferencing the returned pointer yields the target node. During insertion, this pointer can both check for existing nodes with the same key and directly insert new nodes at the correct position. During deletion, nodes can be removed directly by modifying the value this pointer points to, without needing to record the predecessor node.</p><h3 id="Remove-Operation"><a href="#Remove-Operation" class="headerlink" title="Remove Operation"></a>Remove Operation</h3><p>The Remove operation for deleting a key is <a href="https://github.com/google/leveldb/blob/main/util/cache.cc#L95">implemented</a> as follows:</p><figure class="highlight cpp"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="function">LRUHandle* <span class="title">Remove</span><span class="params">(<span class="type">const</span> Slice&amp; key, <span class="type">uint32_t</span> hash)</span> </span>&#123;</span><br><span class="line">  LRUHandle** ptr = <span class="built_in">FindPointer</span>(key, hash);</span><br><span class="line">  LRUHandle* result = *ptr;</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="keyword">if</span> (result != <span class="literal">nullptr</span>) &#123;</span><br><span class="line">    *ptr = result-&gt;next_hash;</span><br><span class="line">    --elems_;</span><br><span class="line">  &#125;</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="keyword">return</span> result;</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>Simple, right? To delete a specified node in a linked list, it first uses FindPointer to find the address of the pointer pointing to the list node, then <strong>assigns the address of the next node (result-&gt;next_hash) to the original pointer position</strong>, completing the deletion operation. This method returns the pointer to the deleted node, allowing the caller to handle subsequent processing (such as memory deallocation). This implementation approach <strong>doesn’t need to record the predecessor node, is simple and efficient, and can correctly handle the deletion of head nodes</strong>.</p><p>This deletion method can elegantly handle all of the following cases:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Case</th><th>Description</th><th>Initial State</th><th>State After Deletion</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>Delete first node A</td><td>list_[i] –&gt; [A] –&gt; [B] –&gt; [C] –&gt; nullptr</td><td>list_[i] –&gt; [B] –&gt; [C] –&gt; nullptr</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Delete middle node B</td><td>list_[i] –&gt; [A] –&gt; [B] –&gt; [C] –&gt; nullptr</td><td>list_[i] –&gt; [A] –&gt; [C] –&gt; nullptr</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Delete last node C</td><td>list_[i] –&gt; [A] –&gt; [B] –&gt; [C] –&gt; nullptr</td><td>list_[i] –&gt; [A] –&gt; [B] –&gt; nullptr</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Delete only node A</td><td>list_[i] –&gt; [A] –&gt; nullptr</td><td>list_[i] –&gt; nullptr</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>Key to delete doesn’t exist</td><td>list_[i] –&gt; [A] –&gt; [B] –&gt; nullptr</td><td>list_[i] –&gt; [A] –&gt; [B] –&gt; nullptr</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>Hash bucket is empty</td><td>list_[i] –&gt; nullptr</td><td>list_[i] –&gt; nullptr</td></tr></tbody></table><h3 id="Insert-Operation"><a href="#Insert-Operation" class="headerlink" title="Insert Operation"></a>Insert Operation</h3><p>The <a href="https://github.com/google/leveldb/blob/main/util/cache.cc#L79">Insert method</a> for inserting nodes is similar to deletion, first finding the insertion position and then performing the insertion:</p><figure class="highlight cpp"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="function">LRUHandle* <span class="title">Insert</span><span class="params">(LRUHandle* h)</span> </span>&#123;</span><br><span class="line">  LRUHandle** ptr = <span class="built_in">FindPointer</span>(h-&gt;<span class="built_in">key</span>(), h-&gt;hash);</span><br><span class="line">  LRUHandle* old = *ptr;</span><br><span class="line">  h-&gt;next_hash = (old == <span class="literal">nullptr</span> ? <span class="literal">nullptr</span> : old-&gt;next_hash);</span><br><span class="line">  *ptr = h;</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="comment">// ...</span></span><br><span class="line">  <span class="keyword">return</span> old;</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>Line 4 here uses double pointers to handle all of the following cases at once (we’ll discuss double pointers in detail later):</p><table><thead><tr><th>Case</th><th>Description</th><th>Initial State</th><th>State After Insertion</th><th>Return Value</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>Insert into empty bucket</td><td>list_[i] –&gt; nullptr</td><td>list_[i] –&gt; [H] –&gt; nullptr</td><td>nullptr</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Key exists (first node)</td><td>list_[i] –&gt; [A] –&gt; [B] –&gt; nullptr</td><td>list_[i] –&gt; [H] –&gt; [B] –&gt; nullptr</td><td>A</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Key exists (middle node)</td><td>list_[i] –&gt; [A] –&gt; [B] –&gt; [C] –&gt; nullptr</td><td>list_[i] –&gt; [A] –&gt; [H] –&gt; [C] –&gt; nullptr</td><td>B</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Key exists (last node)</td><td>list_[i] –&gt; [A] –&gt; [B] –&gt; nullptr</td><td>list_[i] –&gt; [A] –&gt; [H] –&gt; nullptr</td><td>B</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>Insert new key (non-empty bucket)</td><td>list_[i] –&gt; [A] –&gt; [B] –&gt; nullptr</td><td>list_[i] –&gt; [A] –&gt; [B] –&gt; [H] –&gt; nullptr</td><td>nullptr</td></tr></tbody></table><p>After insertion, it checks old to determine if this is a new node.

In extreme cases, each key might have a long collision chain, causing hash table lookup and deletion performance to degrade. To <strong>measure the severity of hash collisions</strong>, we can define the <strong>load factor &#x3D; number of hash table elements &#x2F; number of hash buckets</strong>. Once this value exceeds a threshold, expansion is needed.</p><p>Earlier in the Insert method, when inserting elements, it tracks the current hash table element count. Once the load factor exceeds the threshold of 1, it calls <code>Resize()</code> to expand:</p><figure class="highlight cpp"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">if</span> (old == <span class="literal">nullptr</span>) &#123;</span><br><span class="line">    ++elems_;</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">if</span> (elems_ &gt; length_) &#123;</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="comment">// Since each cache entry is fairly large, we aim for a small</span></span><br><span class="line">    <span class="comment">// average linked list length (&lt;= 1).</span></span><br><span class="line">    <span class="built_in">Resize</span>();</span><br><span class="line">    &#125;</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p><strong>The first problem to solve in expansion is deciding the new hash bucket count</strong>.

Compared to traditional insertion that traverses to the list tail, <strong>head insertion is simpler, only needing to insert at the head without traversing to the tail, so the operation time complexity is O(1)</strong>. Additionally, using head insertion doesn’t require maintaining a tail pointer, making it <strong>more space efficient</strong>. Furthermore, <strong>head insertion has cache locality benefits - recently inserted nodes are at the head of the list, improving lookup efficiency for certain access patterns</strong>.</p><h2 id="Understanding-Double-Pointers-in-C"><a href="#Understanding-Double-Pointers-in-C" class="headerlink" title="Understanding Double Pointers in C++"></a>Understanding Double Pointers in C++</h2><p>The linked list operation code is very concise, without various complex conditional checks, thanks to the good use of double pointers. So how should we understand double pointers in C++? <strong>In C++, objects have values and corresponding memory addresses, pointers store object memory addresses, and double pointers store pointer addresses</strong>.</p><p>Let’s look at a clearer example. Suppose a bucket has a collision chain <code>bucket-&gt;A-&gt;B-&gt;nullptr</code>, which can be represented by this C++ code:</p><figure class="highlight cpp"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">LRUHandle *node_a;    <span class="comment">// Address: 0x100, Data: &#123;value: &quot;A&quot;, next_hash: 0x200&#125;</span></span><br><span class="line">LRUHandle *node_b;    <span class="comment">// Address: 0x200, Data: &#123;value: &quot;B&quot;, next_hash: nullptr&#125;</span></span><br><span class="line">node_a-&gt;next_hash = node_b;</span><br><span class="line">LRUHandle* bucket = node_a;   <span class="comment">// Address: 0x300, Data: 0x100</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>Of course, the specific memory address values here are just for understanding - the actual runtime memory addresses will be different. Now there’s a new node node_h with address 0x500. To insert this node into the above list using head insertion, the core code is just 3 lines:</p><figure class="highlight cpp"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">LRUHandle** ptr = &amp;new_list[hash &amp; (new_length - <span class="number">1</span>)];</span><br><span class="line">h-&gt;next_hash = *ptr;    </span><br><span class="line">*ptr = h;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>Let’s look at the changes from each line. After the first line executes, the overall memory layout is:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Variable Name</th><th>Memory Address</th><th>Stored Value</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>ptr</td><td>0x400</td><td>0x300</td></tr><tr><td>bucket</td><td>0x300</td><td>0x100</td></tr><tr><td>node_a</td><td>0x100</td><td>{value: “A”, next_hash: 0x200}</td></tr><tr><td>node_b</td><td>0x200</td><td>{value: “B”, next_hash: nullptr}</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Then executing <code>h-&gt;next_hash = *ptr</code> points node_h’s next_hash to *ptr, where *ptr gets A’s address. The overall memory layout becomes:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Variable Name</th><th>Memory Address</th><th>Stored Value</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>ptr</td><td>0x400</td><td>0x300</td></tr><tr><td>bucket</td><td>0x300</td><td>0x100 (*ptr)</td></tr><tr><td>node_h</td><td>0x500</td><td>{value: “H”, next_hash: <strong>0x100</strong>}</td></tr><tr><td>node_a</td><td><strong>0x100</strong></td><td>{value: “A”, next_hash: <strong>0x200</strong>}</td></tr><tr><td>node_b</td><td><strong>0x200</strong></td><td>{value: “B”, next_hash: nullptr}</td></tr></tbody></table><p>At this point we’ve built the <strong>H-&gt;A-&gt;B-&gt;nullptr</strong> chain. But bucket still points to A, so we need to execute <code>*ptr = h</code> to make bucket point to node_h’s address. After this step, the overall memory layout becomes:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Variable Name</th><th>Memory Address</th><th>Stored Value</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>ptr</td><td>0x400</td><td>0x300</td></tr><tr><td>bucket</td><td>0x300</td><td><strong>0x500</strong></td></tr><tr><td>node_h</td><td><strong>0x500</strong></td><td>{value: “H”, next_hash: <strong>0x100</strong>}</td></tr><tr><td>node_a</td><td><strong>0x100</strong></td><td>{value: “A”, next_hash: <strong>0x200</strong>}</td></tr><tr><td>node_b</td><td><strong>0x200</strong></td><td>{value: “B”, next_hash: nullptr}</td></tr></tbody></table><p>With this, we’ve completed building <code>p-&gt;bucket-&gt;H-&gt;A-&gt;B-&gt;nullptr</code>.</p><h2 id="Summary"><a href="#Summary" class="headerlink" title="Summary"></a>Summary</h2><p>We’ve analyzed LevelDB’s hash table implementation in detail. Here are the key points for designing a high-performance hash table:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Clever Use of Double Pointers</strong> - By returning a pointer to the node pointer, the FindPointer method can be reused in lookup, insertion, and deletion operations, greatly simplifying linked list operation code.</p></li><li><p><strong>Efficient Collision Handling</strong> - Uses chaining to handle hash collisions and optimizes list insertion with head insertion, avoiding the overhead of traversing to the list tail.</p></li><li><p><strong>Dynamic Expansion Mechanism</strong> - Monitors the load factor and expands by a factor of 2 at appropriate times, balancing space utilization and performance.</p></li><li><p><strong>Concise and Elegant Implementation</strong> - The entire implementation has minimal code but includes all core hash table functionality, making it an excellent learning example.</p></li></ol><p>While this implementation is primarily used for LevelDB’s LRU Cache, many of its design principles are valuable references for implementing other high-performance data structures. In particular, the use of double pointers demonstrates the power of pointers in C++.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <description>This article provides a detailed analysis of the time complexity of skip lists. By breaking down the search problem, reversing the entire search process, and finding an appropriate L level, it ultimately derives the time complexity of skip lists. Based on the understanding of time complexity, it further deduces how to choose the probability p, and the reasons for choosing the maximum height in Redis and LevelDB skip lists. Finally, it tests the performance of skip lists through a simple benchmark and compares it with unordered_map.</description>
      
      
      
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the previous article <a href="https://selfboot.cn/en/2024/09/09/leveldb_source_skiplist/">LevelDB Explained - How to implement SkipList</a>, we analyzed in detail the implementation of skip lists in LevelDB. Then in <a href="https://selfboot.cn/en/2024/09/18/leveldb_source_skiplist_test/">LevelDB Explained - How to Test Parallel Read and Write of SkipLists?</a>, we analyzed the test code for LevelDB skip lists. One question remains: how do we analyze the time complexity of skip lists?</p><p>After analyzing the time complexity of skip lists, we can understand <strong>the choice of probability value and maximum height</strong> in LevelDB, as well as why Redis chooses a different maximum height. Finally, this article will also provide a simple benchmark code to examine the performance of skip lists.</p><p>This article will not involve very advanced mathematical knowledge, only simple probability theory, so you can read on without worry. The performance analysis of skip lists has several approaches worth learning from. I hope this article can serve as a starting point and bring some inspiration to everyone.</p><h2 id="Breaking-Down-Skip-List-Performance-Analysis"><a href="#Breaking-Down-Skip-List-Performance-Analysis" class="headerlink" title="Breaking Down Skip List Performance Analysis"></a>Breaking Down Skip List Performance Analysis</h2><p>Knowing the principles and implementation of LevelDB, we can deduce that in extreme cases, where the height of each node is 1, the time complexity of search, insertion, and deletion operations of the skip list will degrade to O(n). In this case, the performance is considerably worse than balanced trees. Of course, due to the randomness involved, <strong>no input sequence can consistently lead to the worst performance</strong>.</p><p>So, how about the average performance of skip lists? We’ve previously stated the conclusion that it’s similar to the average performance of balanced trees. Introducing a simple random height can ensure that the average performance of skip lists is comparable to balanced trees. <strong>Is there any analysis method behind this that can analyze the performance of skip lists?</strong></p><span id="more"></span><p>We need to look at the paper again. The paper provides a good analysis method, but the approach here is actually a bit difficult to come up with, and understanding it is also a bit challenging. I will try to break down the problem as much as possible, then derive the entire process step by step, and try to provide the mathematical derivation involved in each step. Haha, <strong>isn’t this the chain of thought? Breaking down problems and reasoning step by step is an essential skill for both humans and AI to solve complex problems</strong>. The derivation here can be divided into several small problems:</p><ol><li>Among the search, insertion, and deletion operations of skip lists, which part of the operation most affects the time consumption?</li><li>For the search operation, assuming we start searching downwards from any level k, what is the average complexity here (how many traversals)?</li><li>Is there a way to <strong>find a certain level</strong> in the linked list, from which starting the search is most efficient, and the number of traversals can represent the average performance?</li><li>Can we find a formula to calculate the total time complexity and calculate the upper limit of the average complexity here?</li></ol><p>Alright, let’s analyze these problems one by one.</p><h2 id="Bottleneck-of-Skip-List-Operations"><a href="#Bottleneck-of-Skip-List-Operations" class="headerlink" title="Bottleneck of Skip List Operations"></a>Bottleneck of Skip List Operations</h2><p>The first small problem is relatively simple. In the previous discussion of the principles and implementation of skip lists, we know that for insertion and deletion operations, we also need to first find the corresponding position through the search operation. After that, it’s just a few pointer operations, the cost of which is constant time and can be ignored. Therefore, <strong>the time complexity of skip list operations is determined by the complexity of the search operation</strong>.</p><p>The process of the search operation is to search right and down in the skip list until the target element is found. If we can know the average complexity of this search, then we can know the average complexity of skip list operations. Directly analyzing the average complexity of the search operation is a bit difficult to start. According to the implementation in LevelDB, each time it starts searching from <strong>the highest level of the current node in the skip list</strong>. But the node height is random, and the highest level is also random, so it seems impossible to analyze the average complexity of the search operation starting from a random height.</p><h2 id="Expected-Number-of-Steps-to-Skip-k-Levels"><a href="#Expected-Number-of-Steps-to-Skip-k-Levels" class="headerlink" title="Expected Number of Steps to Skip k Levels"></a>Expected Number of Steps to Skip k Levels</h2><p>Let’s give up on direct analysis for now and try to answer the second question from earlier. <strong>Assuming we start searching downwards from any level k, how many times on average does it take to find the target position?</strong> The analysis approach here is quite jumpy. We’ll <strong>analyze in reverse from the target position, searching up and left, how many steps on average does it take to search up k levels. And we assume that the height of nodes in the linked list is randomly decided based on probability p during the reverse search process</strong>.</p><p>Is this assumption and analysis process equivalent to the average number of searches in the real search situation? We know that when executing the search to the right and down, the heights of the nodes are already decided. But considering that the height of nodes is randomly decided in the first place, <strong>assuming that the height is decided during the reverse search and reversing the entire search process is not statistically different</strong>.</p><p>Next, let’s assume that <strong>we are currently at any level i of node x (situation a in the figure below), and it takes $ C(k) $ steps to search up k levels from this position</strong>. We don’t know if there are any more levels above node x, nor do we know if there are any nodes to the left of node x (the <strong>shaded question marks in the figure below</strong> represent this uncertainty). Let’s further assume that x is not the header node, and there are nodes to its left (in fact, for this analysis, we can assume there are infinitely many nodes to the left).</p><p><img src="https://slefboot-1251736664.file.myqcloud.com/20240914_leveldb_source_skiplist_more.png" alt="LevelDB time complexity analysis of search complexity from K levels (image from the paper)"></p><p>Then there are two possible situations for the entire linked list, as shown in the figure above:</p><ul><li>Situation b: Node x has a total of i levels, there are nodes to the left, and when searching, we need to horizontally jump from the i-th level of the left node to the i-th level of x. In reverse analysis, because we decide whether to have a higher level based on probability $ p $, the probability of being in situation b is $ 1 - p $. Then <strong>the left node and x are on the same level, and it still takes $ C(k) $ steps to search up k levels</strong>. Therefore, the expected number of search steps in this situation is: $ (1 - p) * (C(k) + 1) $.</li><li>Situation c: The height of node x is greater than i, so when searching, we need to jump down from the i+1-th level of x to the i-th level. In reverse analysis, because we decide whether to have a higher level based on probability $ p $, the probability of being in situation c is $ p $. Then <strong>searching up k levels from the i+1-th level is equivalent to searching up k-1 levels from the i-th level, which takes $ C(k-1) $ steps</strong>. Therefore, the expected number of search steps is: $ p * (C(k-1) + 1) $.</li></ul><p>That is to say, for searching starting from any level i, the expected number of steps to jump up $ k $ levels is:</p><p>$$ \begin{align}<br>C(k) &amp;&#x3D; (1 - p) * (C(k) + 1) + p * (C(k-1) + 1)<br>\end{align} $$</p><p>Simplifying this equation gives the following result:</p><p>$$<br>\begin{align}<br>C(k) &amp;&#x3D; 1&#x2F;p + C(k-1)<br>\\<br>C(k) &amp;&#x3D; k&#x2F;p<br>\end{align}<br>$$</p><p>The expected number of steps $ k&#x2F;p $ to jump up k levels starting from any level i here is also equivalent to the expected number of steps needed to search from level k to the target position at the bottom level in the normal search procedure. This formula is very important. As long as you <strong>understand the reverse analysis steps here, the final formula is also relatively easy to derive</strong>. However, we still can’t directly analyze the average performance of skip lists with this formula. Something is missing in between.</p><h2 id="From-Which-Level-to-Start-Searching"><a href="#From-Which-Level-to-Start-Searching" class="headerlink" title="From Which Level to Start Searching?"></a>From Which Level to Start Searching?</h2><p>From the above analysis, we can see that the time complexity of searching from the K-th level to the bottom level is $ k&#x2F;p $. So when actually searching the skip list, which level is better to start searching from? From <a href="https://selfboot.cn/2024/09/09/leveldb_source_skiplist/">LevelDB Source Code Reading: Principles, Implementation, and Visualization of Skip Lists</a>, we know that the level height of nodes in the skip list is random, <strong>for a certain level, there may be multiple nodes, and the higher the level, the fewer the nodes</strong>.</p><p>In LevelDB’s implementation, it <strong>starts searching from the highest level of the skip list</strong>. But in fact, if you start searching from the highest level, you might be doing a lot of unnecessary work. For example, in the skip list below, the level corresponding to 79 is very high. Starting the search from this level requires going down many steps, which are all ineffective searches. If we start searching from the level height corresponding to 5, we save a lot of search steps. The following image is from the <a href="https://gallery.selfboot.cn/en/algorithms/skiplist">skip list visualization page</a>:</p><p><img src="https://slefboot-1251736664.file.myqcloud.com/20240920_leveldb_source_skiplist_more_search_start.png" alt="LevelDB skip list search starting level analysis"></p><p>Ideally, we want to start searching from an “<strong>appropriate</strong>“ level. The paper defines the appropriate level as: <strong>the level where we expect to see $1&#x2F;p$ nodes</strong>. Since we usually choose values like 1&#x2F;2, 1&#x2F;4 for p, we generally start searching from a level with 2 or 4 nodes. Starting the search from this level avoids doing unnecessary work and also avoids losing the advantages of skip lists by starting from too low a level. Next, we only need to know <strong>how high such a level is on average</strong>, and then combine it with the previous $ k&#x2F;p $ to know the overall search complexity.</p><h3 id="Level-Height-Calculation"><a href="#Level-Height-Calculation" class="headerlink" title="Level Height Calculation"></a>Level Height Calculation</h3><p>Now let’s look at the specific calculation steps. Assume there are $ n $ nodes in total, and there are $ 1&#x2F;p $ nodes at the $ L $-th level. Since we decide whether to jump to the upper level with probability $ p $ each time, we have:</p><p>$$ n * p^{L-1} &#x3D; 1&#x2F;p $$</p><p>Note that jumping L levels means jumping L-1 times, so $ p^{L-1} $ here is to the power of L-1. Multiplying both sides of the equation by p:</p><p>$$<br>\begin{align}<br>(n \cdot p^{L-1}) \cdot p &amp;&#x3D; \frac{1}{p} \cdot p \\<br>n \cdot p^{L} &amp;&#x3D; 1<br>\end{align}<br>$$</p><p>Then take the logarithm $ log_{1&#x2F;p} $ on both sides, as follows. Here we use the multiplication rule and power rule of logarithms:</p><p>$$<br>\begin{align}<br>\log_{1&#x2F;p} (n \cdot p^{L}) &amp;&#x3D; \log_{1&#x2F;p} 1<br>\\<br>\log_{1&#x2F;p} n + L \cdot \log_{1&#x2F;p} p &amp;&#x3D; 0<br>\end{align}<br>$$</p><p>Then simplify:</p><p>$$<br>\begin{align}<br>log_{1&#x2F;p} p &amp;&#x3D; -1<br>\\<br>log_{1&#x2F;p} n + L * (-1) &amp;&#x3D; 0<br>\end{align}<br>$$</p><p>So we get:</p><p>$$<br>L &#x3D; log_{1&#x2F;p} n<br>$$</p><p>That is, at level $ L &#x3D; log_{1&#x2F;p} n$, we expect to have $ 1&#x2F;p $ nodes. Here’s a supplement to the logarithm rules used in the above derivation:</p><p>$$<br>\begin{align}<br>\log(xy) &amp;&#x3D; \log(x) + \log(y)  &amp;\text{Multiplication rule of logarithms}<br>\\<br>\log(x^n) &amp;&#x3D; n \cdot \log(x) &amp;\text{Power rule of logarithms}<br>\end{align}<br>$$</p><h2 id="Total-Time-Complexity"><a href="#Total-Time-Complexity" class="headerlink" title="Total Time Complexity"></a>Total Time Complexity</h2><p>Alright, the key parts have been analyzed. Now let’s look at the total time complexity by combining the above conclusions. For a skip list with $n$ nodes, we can divide the search process into two parts: one is from the $L$-th level to the bottom level, and the other is from the top to the $L$-th level.</p><p>From the $L$-th level to the bottom level, according to the equivalent reverse analysis earlier, it’s equivalent to climbing up $L$ levels from the bottom level. The cost of this climb is:</p><p>$$<br>\begin{align}<br>O(n) &amp;&#x3D; \frac{L}{p}<br>\\<br>O(n) &amp;&#x3D; \frac{log_{1&#x2F;p} n}{p}<br>\end{align}<br>$$</p><p>Then from the top to the $L$-th level, this part is also divided into left and up. The number of steps to the left is at most the number of nodes at the $L$-th level, which is $\frac{1}{p}$. As for going up, in LevelDB’s implementation, the highest level is limited to 12 levels, so the number of steps up is also a constant. In fact, even if we don’t limit the height of the entire skip list, its expected maximum height can be calculated (the calculation process is omitted here, it’s not very important):</p><p>$$ H ≤ L + \frac{1}{1-p}$$</p><p>So in the case of unlimited height, the overall upper limit of time complexity here is:</p><p>$$ O(n) &#x3D; \frac{log_{1&#x2F;p} n}{p} + \frac{1}{1-p} + \frac{1}{p} $$</p><p>The time complexity above is actually $ O(log n) $. Finally, one more thing to say, although it’s better to start searching from the L-th level, there’s no need to do so in actual implementation. Like LevelDB, after limiting the overall skip list height, starting the search from the current maximum height of the skip list won’t perform much worse. Because the cost of searching upwards from the L-th level is constant, so there’s no significant impact. Moreover, in the actual implementation, the maximum number of layers is also calculated based on p and n to a value close to the L layer.</p><h2 id="Choice-of-P-Value"><a href="#Choice-of-P-Value" class="headerlink" title="Choice of P Value"></a>Choice of P Value</h2><p>The paper also analyzes the impact of p value choice on performance and space occupation, which is worth mentioning here. Obviously, the smaller the p value, the higher the space efficiency (fewer pointers per node), but the search time usually increases. The overall situation is as follows:</p><table><thead><tr><th>p</th><th>Normalized search times (i.e., normalized L(n)&#x2F;p)</th><th>Avg. # of pointers per node (i.e., 1&#x2F;(1-p))</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1&#x2F;2</td><td>1</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>1&#x2F;e</td><td>0.94…</td><td>1.58…</td></tr><tr><td>1&#x2F;4</td><td>1</td><td>1.33…</td></tr><tr><td>1&#x2F;8</td><td>1.33…</td><td>1.14…</td></tr><tr><td>1&#x2F;16</td><td>2</td><td>1.07…</td></tr></tbody></table><p>The paper recommends choosing a p value of 1&#x2F;4, which has good time constants and relatively little average space per node. The implementation in LevelDB chose p &#x3D; 1&#x2F;4, and Redis’s <a href="https://github.com/redis/redis/blob/438cfed70a203c8b708e6df200d1ad82c87f2901/src/t_zset.c#L126">zset implementation</a> also chose <a href="https://github.com/redis/redis/blob/unstable/src/server.h#L516">ZSKIPLIST_P</a>&#x3D;1&#x2F;4.</p><p>In addition, regarding the choice of the highest level, <a href="https://github.com/google/leveldb/blob/main/db/skiplist.h#L100">LevelDB</a> implementation chose 12 levels, while <a href="https://github.com/redis/redis/blob/438cfed70a203c8b708e6df200d1ad82c87f2901/src/t_zset.c#L515C1-L515C71">Redis</a> chose 32 levels. What considerations are these based on?</p><p>Going back to the previous analysis, we know that starting the search from an appropriate level is most efficient, where the appropriate level is $ log_{1&#x2F;p} n $. Now that p is determined to be 1&#x2F;4, as long as we can estimate the maximum number of nodes N in the skiplist, we can know what the appropriate level is. Then setting the maximum number of levels to this value can ensure the average performance of the skip list. Below is the appropriate number of levels for different numbers of nodes when p&#x3D;1&#x2F;4:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Probability p</th><th>Number of nodes n</th><th>Appropriate level (max level)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1&#x2F;4</td><td>$2^{16}$</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>1&#x2F;4</td><td>$2^{20}$</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>1&#x2F;4</td><td>$2^{24}$</td><td>12</td></tr><tr><td>1&#x2F;4</td><td>$2^{32}$</td><td>16</td></tr><tr><td>1&#x2F;4</td><td>$2^{64}$</td><td>32</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Redis chose 32 levels because it needs to support up to 2^64 elements. In LevelDB, skip lists are used to store keys in Memtable and SSTable, where the number of keys won’t be very large, so 12 levels were chosen, which can support a maximum of 2^24 elements.</p><h2 id="Performance-Test-Benchmark"><a href="#Performance-Test-Benchmark" class="headerlink" title="Performance Test Benchmark"></a>Performance Test Benchmark</h2><p>LevelDB doesn’t test the performance of skip lists, so let’s write a simple one ourselves. Here we use Google’s benchmark library to test the insertion and search performance of skip lists. For easy comparison, we’ve also added a test for unordered_map to see the performance difference between the two. The core code for testing skip list insertion is as follows:</p><figure class="highlight cpp"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br><span class="line">12</span><br><span class="line">13</span><br><span class="line">14</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="function"><span class="type">static</span> <span class="type">void</span> <span class="title">BM_SkipListInsertSingle</span><span class="params">(benchmark::State&amp; state)</span> </span>&#123;</span><br><span class="line">  TestContext context;</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="built_in">SetUp</span>(state, &amp;context);</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">  <span class="keyword">for</span> (<span class="keyword">auto</span> _ : state) &#123;</span><br><span class="line">    context.skiplist-&gt;<span class="built_in">Insert</span>(context.key_to_insert);</span><br><span class="line">    benchmark::<span class="built_in">DoNotOptimize</span>(context.skiplist);</span><br><span class="line">    state.<span class="built_in">PauseTiming</span>();</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="built_in">SetUp</span>(state, &amp;context);</span><br><span class="line">    state.<span class="built_in">ResumeTiming</span>();</span><br><span class="line">  &#125;</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">  state.<span class="built_in">SetLabel</span>(<span class="string">&quot;SkipList Single Insert&quot;</span>);</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>This performs random number insertion and search for different skip list and unordered_map table lengths, then calculates the average time consumption.

      <description>This article delves into the testing methods of LevelDB&#39;s skip list implementation, focusing on verifying correctness in parallel read and write scenarios. It details the clever design of test Keys, the implementation of write and read thread operations, and specific methods for single-threaded and multi-threaded testing. The article also discusses the limitations of parallel testing and introduces the ThreadSanitizer tool for deeper data race detection.</description>
      
      
      
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the previous article <a href="https://selfboot.cn/en/2024/09/09/leveldb_source_skiplist/">LevelDB Source Code Reading: Principles, Implementation, and Visualization of Skip Lists</a>, we started by discussing the drawbacks of current binary search trees and balanced trees, which led to the introduction of skip lists as a data structure. Then, combining with the original paper, we explained the implementation principles of skip lists. Next, we analyzed in detail the code implementation in LevelDB, including the iterator implementation and <strong>extreme performance optimization for parallel reading</strong>. Finally, we provided a visualization page that intuitively shows the skip list construction process.</p><p>However, two questions remain:</p><ol><li>How to test the LevelDB skip list code to ensure functional correctness? Especially, <strong>how to ensure the correctness of skip list implementation in parallel read and write scenarios</strong>.</li><li>How to <strong>quantitatively analyze</strong> the time complexity of skip lists?</li></ol><p>Next, by analyzing LevelDB’s test code, we’ll first answer the first question. The quantitative analysis of skip list performance will be covered in a separate article.</p><span id="more"></span><h2 id="Skip-List-Test-Analysis"><a href="#Skip-List-Test-Analysis" class="headerlink" title="Skip List Test Analysis"></a>Skip List Test Analysis</h2><p>In <a href="https://selfboot.cn/en/2024/09/09/leveldb_source_skiplist/">the previous article</a>, we analyzed the implementation of LevelDB’s skip list. So, is this implementation correct? If we were to write test cases, how should we write them? From which aspects should we test the correctness of the skip list? Let’s look at LevelDB’s test code <a href="https://github.com/google/leveldb/blob/main/db/skiplist_test.cc">skiplist_test.cc</a>.</p><p>First is the <strong>empty skip list test</strong>, which verifies that an empty skip list contains no elements and checks the iterator operations of an empty skip list such as SeekToFirst, Seek, SeekToLast, etc. Then there are test cases for insertion, lookup, and iterator, which verify whether the skip list correctly contains these keys and test the forward and backward traversal of the iterator by continuously inserting a large number of randomly generated key-value pairs.</p><figure class="highlight cpp"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="built_in">TEST</span>(SkipTest, InsertAndLookup) &#123;</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="comment">// Test insertion and lookup functionality</span></span><br><span class="line">  <span class="comment">// Insert randomly generated key-value pairs</span></span><br><span class="line">  <span class="comment">// Verify that the skip list correctly contains these keys</span></span><br><span class="line">  <span class="comment">// Test forward and backward traversal of the iterator</span></span><br><span class="line">&#125;  </span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>These are fairly standard test cases, so we won’t expand on them here. Let’s focus on LevelDB’s <strong>parallel testing</strong>.</p><h3 id="Test-Key-Design"><a href="#Test-Key-Design" class="headerlink" title="Test Key Design"></a>Test Key Design</h3><p>LevelDB’s skip list supports single-threaded write and multi-threaded parallel read. We analyzed the details of parallel read implementation in the previous article, so how should we test it? Let’s first define the test objective: when multiple threads are reading in parallel, <strong>after each read thread initializes its iterator, it should be able to read all the elements currently in the skip list</strong>. Since there’s a write thread running simultaneously, read threads <strong>may also read newly inserted elements</strong>. At any time, <strong>the elements read by read threads should satisfy the properties of a skip list</strong>, i.e., each element should be less than or equal to the next element.</p><p>LevelDB’s test method is designed quite cleverly. First is a <strong>carefully designed element value Key</strong> (capitalized here to distinguish from key), with clear comments:</p><figure class="highlight cpp"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="comment">// We generate multi-part keys:</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="comment">//     &lt;key,gen,hash&gt;</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="comment">// where:</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="comment">//     key is in range [0..K-1]</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="comment">//     gen is a generation number for key</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="comment">//     hash is hash(key,gen)</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="comment">//</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="comment">// The insertion code picks a random key, sets gen to be 1 + the last</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="comment">// generation number inserted for that key, and sets hash to Hash(key,gen).</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="comment">//</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>The skip list element value consists of three parts: key is randomly generated, gen is the incremental insertion sequence number, and hash is the hash value of key and gen. All three parts are placed in a uint64_t integer, with the high 24 bits being key, the middle 32 bits being gen, and the low 8 bits being hash. Below is the code for extracting the three parts from Key and generating Key from key and gen:</p><figure class="highlight cpp"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br><span class="line">12</span><br><span class="line">13</span><br><span class="line">14</span><br><span class="line">15</span><br><span class="line">16</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">typedef</span> <span class="type">uint64_t</span> Key;</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">class</span> <span class="title class_">ConcurrentTest</span> &#123;</span><br><span class="line"> <span class="keyword">private</span>:</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="type">static</span> <span class="keyword">constexpr</span> <span class="type">uint32_t</span> K = <span class="number">4</span>;</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">  <span class="function"><span class="type">static</span> <span class="type">uint64_t</span> <span class="title">key</span><span class="params">(Key key)</span> </span>&#123; <span class="keyword">return</span> (key &gt;&gt; <span class="number">40</span>); &#125;</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="function"><span class="type">static</span> <span class="type">uint64_t</span> <span class="title">gen</span><span class="params">(Key key)</span> </span>&#123; <span class="keyword">return</span> (key &gt;&gt; <span class="number">8</span>) &amp; <span class="number">0xffffffff</span>u; &#125;</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="function"><span class="type">static</span> <span class="type">uint64_t</span> <span class="title">hash</span><span class="params">(Key key)</span> </span>&#123; <span class="keyword">return</span> key &amp; <span class="number">0xff</span>; &#125;</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="comment">// ...</span></span><br><span class="line">  <span class="function"><span class="type">static</span> Key <span class="title">MakeKey</span><span class="params">(<span class="type">uint64_t</span> k, <span class="type">uint64_t</span> g)</span> </span>&#123;</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="built_in">static_assert</span>(<span class="built_in">sizeof</span>(Key) == <span class="built_in">sizeof</span>(<span class="type">uint64_t</span>), <span class="string">&quot;&quot;</span>);</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="built_in">assert</span>(k &lt;= K);  <span class="comment">// We sometimes pass K to seek to the end of the skiplist</span></span><br><span class="line">    <span class="built_in">assert</span>(g &lt;= <span class="number">0xffffffff</span>u);</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">return</span> ((k &lt;&lt; <span class="number">40</span>) | (g &lt;&lt; <span class="number">8</span>) | (<span class="built_in">HashNumbers</span>(k, g) &amp; <span class="number">0xff</span>));</span><br><span class="line">  &#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p><strong>Why design key this way</strong>? The value of key ranges from 0 to K-1, where K is 4 here. Although key occupies the high 24 bits, its value range is 0-3. In fact, the key value design could work perfectly fine without using the high 24 bits, and it wouldn’t significantly affect the subsequent test logic. I asked gpto1 and claude3.5 about this, but their explanations weren’t convincing. Considering the subsequent parallel read and write test code, my personal understanding is that it might be intended to <strong>simulate seek operations with large spans in the linked list</strong>. Feel free to correct me in the comments section if you have a more plausible explanation!</p><p>The benefits of gen and hash are more obvious. By ensuring gen increments during insertion, read threads can use gen to <strong>verify the order of elements inserted into the skip list</strong>. The low 8 bits of each key is a hash, which can be used to verify <strong>whether the elements read from the skip list are consistent with the inserted elements</strong>, as shown in the IsValidKey method:</p><figure class="highlight cpp"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="function"><span class="type">static</span> <span class="type">uint64_t</span> <span class="title">HashNumbers</span><span class="params">(<span class="type">uint64_t</span> k, <span class="type">uint64_t</span> g)</span> </span>&#123;</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="type">uint64_t</span> data[<span class="number">2</span>] = &#123;k, g&#125;;</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="keyword">return</span> <span class="built_in">Hash</span>(<span class="built_in">reinterpret_cast</span>&lt;<span class="type">char</span>*&gt;(data), <span class="built_in">sizeof</span>(data), <span class="number">0</span>);</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br><span class="line"><span class="function"><span class="type">static</span> <span class="type">bool</span> <span class="title">IsValidKey</span><span class="params">(Key k)</span> </span>&#123;</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="keyword">return</span> <span class="built_in">hash</span>(k) == (<span class="built_in">HashNumbers</span>(<span class="built_in">key</span>(k), <span class="built_in">gen</span>(k)) &amp; <span class="number">0xff</span>);</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>Here, the low 8 bits of the key value are extracted and compared with the hash value generated from key and gen. If they are equal, it indicates that the element is valid. All the above implementations are placed in the <a href="https://github.com/google/leveldb/blob/main/db/skiplist_test.cc#L152">ConcurrentTest class</a>, which serves as an auxiliary class, defining a series of Key-related methods and read&#x2F;write skip list parts.</p><h3 id="Write-Thread-Operation"><a href="#Write-Thread-Operation" class="headerlink" title="Write Thread Operation"></a>Write Thread Operation</h3><p>Next, let’s look at the write thread operation method WriteStep. It’s a public member method of the ConcurrentTest class, with the core code as follows:</p><figure class="highlight cpp"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="comment">// REQUIRES: External synchronization</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="function"><span class="type">void</span> <span class="title">WriteStep</span><span class="params">(Random* rnd)</span> </span>&#123;</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="type">const</span> <span class="type">uint32_t</span> k = rnd-&gt;<span class="built_in">Next</span>() % K;</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="type">const</span> <span class="type">intptr_t</span> g = current_.<span class="built_in">Get</span>(k) + <span class="number">1</span>;</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="type">const</span> Key key = <span class="built_in">MakeKey</span>(k, g);</span><br><span class="line">  list_.<span class="built_in">Insert</span>(key);</span><br><span class="line">  current_.<span class="built_in">Set</span>(k, g);</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>Here, a key is randomly generated, then the previous gen value corresponding to that key is obtained, incremented to generate a new gen value, and the Insert method is called to insert a new key into the skip list. The new key is generated using the previously mentioned MakeKey method, <strong>based on key and gen</strong>. After inserting into the skip list, the gen value corresponding to the key is updated, ensuring that the elements inserted under each key have incremental gen values. The value of key here ranges from 0 to K-1, where K is 4.</p><p>The current_ here is a State structure that <strong>stores the gen value corresponding to each key</strong>, with the code as follows:</p><figure class="highlight cpp"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br><span class="line">12</span><br><span class="line">13</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">struct</span> <span class="title class_">State</span> &#123;</span><br><span class="line">  std::atomic&lt;<span class="type">int</span>&gt; generation[K];</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="function"><span class="type">void</span> <span class="title">Set</span><span class="params">(<span class="type">int</span> k, <span class="type">int</span> v)</span> </span>&#123;</span><br><span class="line">    generation[k].<span class="built_in">store</span>(v, std::memory_order_release);</span><br><span class="line">  &#125;</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="function"><span class="type">int</span> <span class="title">Get</span><span class="params">(<span class="type">int</span> k)</span> </span>&#123; <span class="keyword">return</span> generation[k].<span class="built_in">load</span>(std::memory_order_acquire); &#125;</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">  <span class="built_in">State</span>() &#123;</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">for</span> (<span class="type">int</span> k = <span class="number">0</span>; k &lt; K; k++) &#123;</span><br><span class="line">      <span class="built_in">Set</span>(k, <span class="number">0</span>);</span><br><span class="line">    &#125;</span><br><span class="line">  &#125;</span><br><span class="line">&#125;;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>The State structure has an atomic array generation that stores the gen value corresponding to each key. The use of atomic types and memory_order_release, memory_order_acquire semantics here ensures that <strong>once the write thread updates the gen value of a key, the read thread can immediately read the new value</strong>. For understanding the memory barrier semantics of atomic, you can refer to the Node class design in the skip list implementation from the previous article.</p><h3 id="Read-Thread-Operation"><a href="#Read-Thread-Operation" class="headerlink" title="Read Thread Operation"></a>Read Thread Operation</h3><p>The write thread above is relatively simple, with one thread continuously inserting new elements into the skip list. The read thread is more complex, <strong>not only reading elements from the skip list but also verifying that the data conforms to expectations</strong>. Here’s the overall approach for testing read threads as given in the comments:</p><figure class="highlight cpp"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="comment">// At the beginning of a read, we snapshot the last inserted</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="comment">// generation number for each key.

Afterwards, it uses a while loop to traverse the skip list, verifying that all keys in the <code>[pos, current)</code> interval were not in the initial state initial_state. Here, we can use <strong>proof by contradiction: if there’s a key tmp in the [pos, current) interval that’s also in initial_state, then according to the properties of skip lists, Seek would have found tmp instead of current</strong>. So as long as the linked list is implemented correctly, all keys in the [pos, current) interval should not be in initial_state.</p><p>Of course, we haven’t recorded the key values in the skip list here.

In each iteration, the Env::Default()-&gt;Schedule method is used to create a new thread to execute the ConcurrentReader function, passing state as a parameter. ConcurrentReader will perform read operations in an independent thread, simulating a parallel read environment. Then, it calls state.Wait(TestState::RUNNING) to wait for the read thread to enter the running state before the main thread starts write operations.</p><p>Here, write operations are performed by calling state.t_.WriteStep(&amp;rnd) in a loop, executing kSize write operations on the skip list. Each write operation will insert a new key-value pair into the skip list, simulating the behavior of the write thread. After completing the write operations, state.quit_flag_ is set to true, notifying the read thread to stop reading operations and exit. It then waits for the read thread to complete all operations and exit, ensuring that all read and write operations in the current loop have ended before proceeding to the next test.</p><p>This test uses TestState to synchronize thread states and encapsulates a ConcurrentReader as the read thread method. It also calls the Schedule method encapsulated by Env to execute read operations in an independent thread. This involves condition variables, mutexes, and thread-related content, which we won’t expand on here.</p><p>It’s worth noting that this <strong>only tests the scenario of one write and one read in parallel, and doesn’t test one write with multiple reads</strong>. Multiple read threads could be started in each iteration, with all read threads executing concurrently with the write operation. Alternatively, a fixed pool of read threads could be maintained, with multiple read threads running continuously, operating concurrently with the write thread. However, the current test, through repeated one-write-one-read iterations, can still effectively verify the correctness and stability of the skip list under read-write concurrency.</p><p>Below is a screenshot of the test case execution output:</p><p><img src="https://slefboot-1251736664.file.myqcloud.com/20240918_leveldb_source_skiplist_more_runtest.png" alt="Parallel test output"></p><h2 id="Correctness-of-Parallel-Testing"><a href="#Correctness-of-Parallel-Testing" class="headerlink" title="Correctness of Parallel Testing"></a>Correctness of Parallel Testing</h2><p>The above parallel testing is quite detailed, but it’s worth elaborating a bit more. For this kind of parallel code, especially code involving memory barriers, sometimes <strong>passing tests might just be because issues weren’t triggered</strong> (the probability of problems occurring is very low, and it might also be related to the compiler and CPU model). For example, if I slightly modify the Insert operation here:</p><figure class="highlight cpp"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">for</span> (<span class="type">int</span> i = <span class="number">0</span>; i &lt; height; i++) &#123;</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="comment">// NoBarrier_SetNext() suffices since we will add a barrier when</span></span><br><span class="line">  <span class="comment">// we publish a pointer to &quot;x&quot; in prev[i].</span></span><br><span class="line">  x-&gt;<span class="built_in">NoBarrier_SetNext</span>(i, prev[i]-&gt;<span class="built_in">NoBarrier_Next</span>(i));</span><br><span class="line">  prev[i]-&gt;<span class="built_in">NoBarrier_SetNext</span>(i, x); <span class="comment">// Change here, Use NoBarrier_SetNext</span></span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>Here, both pointers use the NoBarrier_SetNext method to set, then recompile the LevelDB library and test program, run multiple times, and all test cases can pass.</p><p>Of course, in this case, long-term testing can be conducted under different hardware configurations and loads, which might reveal issues.

The complete compilation command is as follows:</p><figure class="highlight shell"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">CC=/usr/bin/clang CXX=/usr/bin/clang++  cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=1 -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS=&quot;-fsanitize=thread&quot; -DCMAKE_C_FLAGS=&quot;-fsanitize=thread&quot; -DCMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS=&quot;-fsanitize=thread&quot; -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$(pwd) .. &amp;&amp; cmake --build . --target install</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>Recompile and link the code with the above modification, run the test case, and the result is as follows:</p><p><img src="https://slefboot-1251736664.file.myqcloud.com/20240918_leveldb_source_skiplist_more_threadsanitizer.png" alt="ThreadSanitizer detecting data race"></p><p>It has precisely located the problematic code. If we undo this erroneous modification and recompile and run, there won’t be any issues. The implementation principle of ThreadSanitizer is quite complex. When the program is compiled, TSan <strong>inserts check code before and after each memory access operation</strong>. During runtime, when the program executes a memory access operation, the inserted code is triggered. This code checks and updates the corresponding shadow memory. It compares the current access with the historical access records of that memory location. If a potential data race is detected, TSan records detailed information, including stack traces.</p><p>Its advantage is that it can detect subtle data races that are difficult to discover through other methods, while providing detailed diagnostic information, which helps to quickly locate and fix problems. However, it significantly increases the program’s runtime and memory usage. It may not be able to detect all types of concurrent errors, especially those that depend on specific timing.</p><h2 id="Summary"><a href="#Summary" class="headerlink" title="Summary"></a>Summary</h2><p>We have completed the analysis of the skip list testing part, focusing on the correctness verification in parallel read and write scenarios. The design of the inserted key value Key and the verification method of read threads are both very clever, worthy of our reference. At the same time, we should recognize that in multi-threaded scenarios, data race detection is sometimes difficult to discover through test cases alone. Tools like ThreadSanitizer can assist in discovering some issues.</p><p>Finally, welcome everyone to leave comments and exchange ideas!</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <description>OpenAI released a new model, o1-preview, claiming stronger code generation and understanding capabilities, with various evaluations showing good results. I immediately tried the new model, including using the popular prompt for generating SVGs with new Chinese interpretations, as well as explaining LevelDB code. Overall, the new o1-preview model shows improvement, but hasn&#39;t created a generational gap.</description>
      
      
      
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>OpenAI quietly released a new model in the middle of the night, <a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-openai-o1-preview/">introducing-openai-o1-preview</a>. They released a series of videos showcasing the power of the new model, and the internet is flooded with articles discussing how impressive the new model’s evaluations are. However, having seen plenty of hype in the AI world, I approached it with a skeptical attitude and immediately tried it out firsthand.</p><h2 id="Chinese-Interpretations"><a href="#Chinese-Interpretations" class="headerlink" title="Chinese Interpretations"></a>Chinese Interpretations</h2><p>Recently, <a href="https://www.lijigang.com/">Li Jigang</a> had a very popular prompt that can generate interesting new interpretations of Chinese characters. I tried it with Claude3.5 and the results were particularly good. Below are some SVG images generated by Claude:</p><p><img src="https://slefboot-1251736664.file.myqcloud.com/20240913_gpto1_hands_on_claude35_demo.png" alt="Claude3.5 examples of new Chinese interpretations"></p><span id="more"></span><p>This prompt is particularly interesting as it uses the classic programming language Lisp to describe the task to be executed, and large language models can actually understand it and generate stable, aesthetically pleasing SVG images. This prompt really tests the model’s understanding and generation capabilities. I tried it with GLM and GPT-4o, but neither could generate SVG images that met the requirements. Currently, only Claude3.5 can consistently output good results. So how does OpenAI’s latest o1-preview model perform?</p><p>We directly output the prompt, then input the words, and the results are as follows:</p><p><img src="https://slefboot-1251736664.file.myqcloud.com/20240913_gpto1_hands_on_preview.png" alt="o1-preview examples of new Chinese interpretations"></p><p>Here, it didn’t output SVG, but provided output in Markdown format. Then, an interesting feature of the new model is that there’s a “thinking” process, <strong>which will show how long it thinks, and you can click to see the thinking process</strong>.</p><p>It seems the model can understand the prompt, but the output is a bit problematic. <a href="https://selfboot.cn/en/2024/06/22/claude35_artifacts/">Claude3.5 can directly output SVG format images because of its Artifacts capability</a>. Here, we can directly prompt o1-preview to generate SVG source code, so we make the prompt a bit more detailed and constrain the output format, like this:</p><blockquote><p>Generate svg source code: Universe</p></blockquote><p>This time it finally gave an SVG source code, generating a new Chinese interpretation image for “Universe”. Then I thought the model had understood my intention, so I directly input “mathematics”, but the model still gave the initial Markdown output. <strong>Each time, you must explicitly prompt “Generate svg source code” before the word</strong> to get the desired SVG format output.

In terms of text content, Claude3.5’s interpretations are also more profound, while gpto1’s are a bit straightforward.</p><h2 id="Code-Understanding-Capability"><a href="#Code-Understanding-Capability" class="headerlink" title="Code Understanding Capability"></a>Code Understanding Capability</h2><p>OpenAI’s new model emphasizes its strong ability to write and understand code, which is exactly what I need. I’ve recently been looking at the <a href="https://selfboot.cn/en/tags/leveldb/">LevelDB source code implementation</a>, and the <a href="https://github.com/google/leveldb/blob/main/db/skiplist_test.cc">test cases</a> for the skip list are a bit complex. Although the code isn’t extensive, it’s a bit challenging to understand.</p><p>I’ve tried using GPT4 and Claude3.5 to interpret it before, and while they provided considerable help, some questions still didn’t get convincing answers. This is a good opportunity to have the o1-preview model interpret it. Before addressing my questions, I first had it read the concurrent testing code here to see how it understands it. The prompt was:</p><blockquote><p>This is the concurrent testing code for LevelDB’s skip list. Please analyze this code and tell me the advantages of this test implementation.</p><p>&#x2F;&#x2F; We want to make sure that with a single writer and multiple<br>&#x2F;&#x2F; concurrent readers (with no synchronization other than when<br>…</p></blockquote><p>When prompting, I provided the complete code, but I’ve omitted the latter part of the code here. The model’s result was fairly good, slightly better than Claude3.5’s previous attempt. It analyzed the code in several parts, including key data structures and concepts, core methods, the execution flow of concurrent testing, and finally summarized the advantages of the test code. Here’s an excerpt:</p><figure class="highlight pgsql"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="number">3.</span> Execution flow <span class="keyword">of</span> concurrent testing</span><br><span class="line">TestState <span class="keyword">class</span>: Manages the test state, including synchronization <span class="keyword">for</span> starting <span class="keyword">and</span> stopping <span class="keyword">read</span> threads.</span><br><span class="line">ConcurrentReader: The execution <span class="keyword">function</span> <span class="keyword">for</span> <span class="keyword">read</span> threads, continuously calling ReadStep <span class="keyword">until</span> receiving a stop signal.</span><br><span class="line">RunConcurrent: The main test <span class="keyword">function</span>.</span><br><span class="line">Creates a TestState instance, starts <span class="keyword">read</span> threads.</span><br><span class="line">The main thread performs <span class="keyword">write</span> operations, continuously calling WriteStep.</span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">After</span> <span class="keyword">write</span> operations are complete, sets the stop signal <span class="keyword">and</span> waits <span class="keyword">for</span> <span class="keyword">read</span> threads <span class="keyword">to</span> <span class="keyword">end</span>.</span><br><span class="line">Test cases: TEST(SkipTest, Concurrent1) <span class="keyword">to</span> TEST(SkipTest, Concurrent5), running multiple concurrent tests respectively.</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>Then came my question:</p><blockquote><p>The value of K here is now 4, why design such a small value?

Couldn’t we just use gen and hash for testing?<br>Also, even if we introduce the K value, taking values from 0 to 4, why give it 24 bits?</p></blockquote><p>The answer seemed to return to the previous pattern, still not providing valuable insights. Of course, Claude3.5 couldn’t give a very good answer to these questions either, and I haven’t come up with a good explanation myself yet. Maybe it’s just something the LevelDB author designed casually, without any particular reason behind it? Feel free to leave your thoughts in the comments section.</p><p>I didn’t get a chance to test the code generation ability as I ran out of quota. According to OpenAI’s documentation, currently o1-preview is limited to 30 messages per week, and o1-mini is 50 messages per week. When I have more quota later, I will continue to try this new model, update this article, and strive to provide a comprehensive evaluation.</p><h2 id="Revisiting-Model-Performance"><a href="#Revisiting-Model-Performance" class="headerlink" title="Revisiting Model Performance"></a>Revisiting Model Performance</h2><p>Over the past year, various new models have continually emerged, occasionally claiming to have set new highs in evaluation set scores. However, from practical experience, many models’ capabilities are still relatively average, with some even being unusable. Large model companies seem keen on chasing benchmarks and exaggerating their models’ capabilities, and even Google and OpenAI are not immune to this trend. Google’s previously released Gemini promotional video was exposed as being edited, and many of OpenAI’s official examples for GPT4o’s multimodal capabilities cannot be reproduced now.</p><p><strong>To evaluate a model’s capabilities, you ultimately need to try it out yourself multiple times</strong>. Recently, I’ve rarely used GPT, instead using Claude3.5 for coding and daily tasks. Whether it’s code generation or text understanding, I feel it’s considerably better than other models. For coding, using cursor paired with Claude3.5 has significantly improved the experience. As a frontend novice with zero foundation, I’ve been able to quickly create many algorithm visualizations using Claude3.5, which are now available on <a href="http://gallery.selfboot.cn/">AI Gallery</a> for everyone to experience.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <description>Skip lists are probabilistic data structures that can replace balanced trees, offering fast insertion, deletion, and search operations. LevelDB&#39;s skip list implementation is concise, stable in performance, and suitable for storing data in memory MemTables. This article starts by discussing the drawbacks of current binary search trees and balanced trees, introducing skip lists as a data structure. Then, based on the original paper, it explains the implementation principles of skip lists, followed by a detailed analysis of LevelDB&#39;s implementation code, including iterator implementation and extreme performance optimization for concurrent reading. Finally, it provides a visualization page that intuitively shows the skip list construction process.</description>
      
      
      
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In LevelDB, the data in the memory MemTable is stored in a SkipList to support fast insertion. Skip lists are probabilistic data structures proposed by William Pugh in his paper <a href="https://15721.courses.cs.cmu.edu/spring2018/papers/08-oltpindexes1/pugh-skiplists-cacm1990.pdf">Skip Lists: A Probabilistic Alternative to Balanced Trees</a>. They are somewhat similar to <strong>ordered linked lists</strong> but can have multiple levels, trading space for time, allowing for fast query, insertion, and deletion operations with an average time complexity of $ O(\log n) $. Compared to some balanced trees, <strong>the code implementation is relatively simple and performance is stable</strong>, making it widely applicable.</p><p><img src="https://slefboot-1251736664.file.myqcloud.com/20240321_leveldb_source_skiplist.png" alt="Inspirational approach to skip list implementation"></p><p>So, what are the principles behind skip lists? How are they implemented in LevelDB? What are the highlights and optimizations in LevelDB’s skip list implementation? How does it support single-threaded writing and concurrent reading of skip lists? This article will delve into these aspects from the principles and implementation of skip lists. Finally, it provides <strong>a visualization page that intuitively shows the construction and overall structure of skip lists</strong>.</p><span id="more"></span><h2 id="Principles-of-Skip-Lists"><a href="#Principles-of-Skip-Lists" class="headerlink" title="Principles of Skip Lists"></a>Principles of Skip Lists</h2><p>Skip lists are primarily used to store ordered data structures. Before delving into the principles of skip lists, let’s first look at how people stored ordered data before skip lists.</p><h3 id="Storing-Ordered-Data"><a href="#Storing-Ordered-Data" class="headerlink" title="Storing Ordered Data"></a>Storing Ordered Data</h3><p>To store ordered abstract data types, the simplest method is to use ordered binary trees, such as binary search trees (BST). In a binary search tree, each node contains a key value that is comparable, allowing ordered operations. <strong>Any node’s left subtree contains only nodes with key values less than that node’s key value, while its right subtree contains only nodes with key values greater than that node’s key value</strong>.</p><p>Based on the structural definition of binary search trees, we can easily think of methods for insertion and search operations. For example, when searching, start from the root node of the tree and move down level by level. If the target key value is less than the current node’s key value, search the left subtree; if the target key value is greater than the current node’s key value, search the right subtree; if they are equal, the target node is found. Insertion is similar, finding the target and inserting at the appropriate position. The deletion operation is slightly more complex, requiring adjustment of the tree structure based on the current node’s subtree situation after finding the target node. We won’t expand on this here, but if you’re interested, you can learn more details in the binary search tree visualization blog.</p><p>The average time complexity of binary search trees is $ O(\log n) $, but if the elements in the binary search tree are <strong>inserted in order</strong>, the tree may degenerate into a linked list, causing the time complexity of operations to degrade from $ O(\log n) $ to $ O(n) $. For example, the following figure shows the structure of a binary search tree after inserting 10 elements in order:</p><p><img src="https://slefboot-1251736664.file.myqcloud.com/20240828_leveldb_source_skiplist_sequential.png" alt="Binary search tree degenerating into a linked list"></p><p>By the way, you can better understand binary search trees <a href="https://gallery.selfboot.cn/en/algorithms/binarysearchtree/">in this visualization page</a>. To solve the performance degradation problem, people have proposed many balanced trees, such as AVL trees and red-black trees. <strong>The implementation of these balanced trees is relatively complex, adding some complicated operations to maintain the balance of the tree.</strong></p><h3 id="The-Idea-of-Skip-Lists"><a href="#The-Idea-of-Skip-Lists" class="headerlink" title="The Idea of Skip Lists"></a>The Idea of Skip Lists</h3><p>The balanced trees mentioned above all <strong>force the tree structure to satisfy certain balance conditions</strong>, thus requiring complex structural adjustments. The author of skip lists, however, took a different approach, introducing <strong>probabilistic balance</strong> rather than mandatory structural balance. Through a <strong>simple randomization process</strong>, skip lists achieve average search time, insertion time, and deletion time similar to balanced trees with lower complexity.</p><p>William Pugh didn’t mention in his paper how he came up with the idea of skip lists, only mentioning in the Related Work section that Sprugnoli proposed a <strong>randomized balanced search tree</strong> in 1981. Perhaps it was this <strong>randomized idea</strong> that inspired Pugh, eventually leading him to propose skip lists. In fact, the randomized idea is quite important. For example, Google’s <a href="https://gallery.selfboot.cn/en/algorithms/jumphash">Jumphash consistent hashing algorithm</a> also uses probability to calculate which hash bucket should be used, which has several advantages compared to the <a href="https://gallery.selfboot.cn/en/algorithms/hashring">hashring</a> method.</p><p>Before getting into the principles of skip lists, let’s review <strong>searching in ordered linked lists</strong>. If we want to search an ordered linked list, we can only scan from the beginning, resulting in a complexity of $ O(n) $. However, this doesn’t take advantage of the <strong>ordered</strong> nature. If it were an ordered array, we could reduce the complexity to $ O(\log n) $ through binary search. The difference between ordered linked lists and ordered arrays is that we can’t quickly access middle elements through indices, only through <strong>pointer traversal</strong>.</p><p>So, is there a way to <strong>skip some nodes</strong> during the search, thereby reducing search time? A fairly intuitive method is to <strong>create more pointers, trading space for time</strong>. Referring back to the figure at the beginning of the article, $ a $ is the original ordered linked list, $ b $ adds some pointer indexes, allowing jumps of 2 nodes at a time, and $ c $ further adds pointer indexes, allowing jumps of 4 nodes at a time.</p><p><img src="https://slefboot-1251736664.file.myqcloud.com/20240828_leveldb_source_skiplist_multilevel.png" alt="Trading space for time, adding node pointers to speed up search"></p><p>If the number of nodes at each level of pointers in the constructed linked list is <strong>1&#x2F;2 of the next level</strong>, then at the highest level, it only takes 1 jump to skip half of the nodes. In such a structure, searching is similar to an ordered array, where we can quickly locate the target node through <strong>binary search</strong>. Since the overall height of the linked list index is $ O(\log n) $, the time complexity of searching is also $ O(\log n) $.</p><p><strong>It looks perfect, as long as we don’t consider insertion and deletion operations</strong>. If we need to insert or delete a new node, we need to <strong>disrupt and reconstruct the entire index layer</strong>, which is disastrous.</p><p>To solve this problem, the author of skip lists, Pugh, introduced the idea of <strong>randomization</strong>, using <strong>random decisions on node height</strong> to avoid the complex index layer reconstruction brought by insertion and deletion operations. At the same time, he mathematically proved that the implementation of skip lists would guarantee an average time complexity of $ O(\log n) $.</p><p>The core idea of skip lists is actually similar to the multi-level index mentioned above, <strong>using multi-level indexes to accelerate searching</strong>. Each level is an ordered linked list, with the bottom level containing all elements. The nodes at each level are a subset of the nodes at the previous level, becoming sparser as we go up. The difference is that in skip lists, the height of levels is <strong>randomly decided</strong>, unlike the above where each level is 1&#x2F;2 of the next level. Therefore, the cost of insertion and deletion operations is <strong>controllable</strong>, unlike the multi-level index which requires reconstructing the entire index layer.</p><p>Of course, there are still many details in the implementation of skip lists. Next, we’ll delve into this through the skip list implementation in LevelDB.</p><h2 id="Implementation-in-LevelDB"><a href="#Implementation-in-LevelDB" class="headerlink" title="Implementation in LevelDB"></a>Implementation in LevelDB</h2><p>The skip list implementation in LevelDB is in <a href="https://github.com/google/leveldb/blob/main/db/skiplist.h">db&#x2F;skiplist.h</a>, mainly the SkipList class. Let’s first look at the design of this class.</p><h3 id="SkipList-Class"><a href="#SkipList-Class" class="headerlink" title="SkipList Class"></a>SkipList Class</h3><p>The SkipList class is defined as a <strong>template class</strong>. By using the template <code>template &lt;typename Key, class Comparator&gt;</code>, the SkipList class can be used for keys of any data type (Key), and the comparison logic for keys can be customized through an external comparator (Comparator). This SkipList only has a <code>.h</code> file, without a <code>.cc</code> file, because the implementation of template classes is usually in the header file.</p><figure class="highlight cpp"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br><span class="line">12</span><br><span class="line">13</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">template</span> &lt;<span class="keyword">typename</span> Key, <span class="keyword">class</span> <span class="title class_">Comparator</span>&gt;</span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">class</span> <span class="title class_">SkipList</span> &#123;</span><br><span class="line"> <span class="keyword">private</span>:</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="keyword">struct</span> <span class="title class_">Node</span>;</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"> <span class="keyword">public</span>:</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="comment">// Create a new SkipList object that will use &quot;cmp&quot; for comparing keys,</span></span><br><span class="line">  <span class="comment">// and will allocate memory using &quot;*arena&quot;.

The SkipList class disables the copy constructor and assignment operator through delete, avoiding accidentally copying the entire skip list (<strong>which is unnecessary and costly</strong>).</p><p>The SkipList class exposes two core operation interfaces, Insert and Contains. Insert is used to insert new nodes, and Contains is used to check if a node exists. There is no operation provided here to delete nodes, because the data in MemTable in LevelDB is <strong>only appended</strong>, and data in the skip list will not be deleted. When deleting a key in the DB, it only adds a deletion type record in the MemTable.</p><figure class="highlight cpp"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="comment">// Insert key into the list.</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="comment">// REQUIRES: nothing that compares equal to key is currently in the list.</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="function"><span class="type">void</span> <span class="title">Insert</span><span class="params">(<span class="type">const</span> Key&amp; key)</span></span>;</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="comment">// Returns true iff an entry that compares equal to key is in the list.</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="function"><span class="type">bool</span> <span class="title">Contains</span><span class="params">(<span class="type">const</span> Key&amp; key)</span> <span class="type">const</span></span>;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>To implement the skip list functionality, the SkipList class internally defines a Node class to represent nodes in the skip list. It is defined as an internal class because this can <strong>improve the encapsulation and maintainability of the skip list</strong>.</p><ul><li>Encapsulation: The Node class is a core part of the SkipList implementation, but users of SkipList usually don’t need to interact directly with node objects. Defining the Node class as a private internal class can hide implementation details;</li><li>Maintainability: If the implementation of the skip list needs to be modified or extended, related changes will be confined to the internal of the SkipList class, without affecting external code using these structures, which helps with code maintenance and debugging.</li></ul><p>The SkipList class also has some private members and methods to assist in implementing the Insert and Contains operations of the skip list. For example:</p><figure class="highlight cpp"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="function"><span class="type">bool</span> <span class="title">KeyIsAfterNode</span><span class="params">(<span class="type">const</span> Key&amp; key, Node* n)</span> <span class="type">const</span></span>;</span><br><span class="line"><span class="function">Node* <span class="title">FindGreaterOrEqual</span><span class="params">(<span class="type">const</span> Key&amp; key, Node** prev)</span> <span class="type">const</span></span>;</span><br><span class="line"><span class="function">Node* <span class="title">FindLessThan</span><span class="params">(<span class="type">const</span> Key&amp; key)</span> <span class="type">const</span></span>;</span><br><span class="line"><span class="function">Node* <span class="title">FindLast</span><span class="params">()</span> <span class="type">const</span></span>;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>In addition, to facilitate the caller to traverse the skip list, a public Iterator class is provided. It encapsulates common iterator operations such as Next, Prev, Seek, SeekToFirst, SeekToLast, etc.</p><p>Next, we’ll first look at the design of the Node class, then analyze how SkipList implements insertion and search operations. Finally, we’ll look at the implementation of the Iterator class provided externally.</p><h3 id="Node-Class"><a href="#Node-Class" class="headerlink" title="Node Class"></a>Node Class</h3><p>The Node class represents a single node in the skip list, including the node’s key value and multiple levels of successor node pointers.

First, calculate the memory size needed for Node, <strong>the size of Node itself plus the size of height minus 1 next pointers</strong>, then call Arena’s AllocateAligned method to allocate memory. Arena is LevelDB’s own memory allocation class, for detailed explanation, you can refer to <a href="https://selfboot.cn/en/2024/08/29/leveldb_source_utils/#Memory-Management-Arena">LevelDB Explained - Arena, Random, CRC32, and More.</a>. Finally, use <strong>placement new to construct Node object</strong>, this is mainly to construct Node object on the memory allocated by Arena, rather than constructing on the heap.</p><p>In addition, the Node class provides 4 methods, Next, SetNext, NoBarrier_Next and NoBarrier_SetNext, used to read and set the pointer to the next node. Here, the functionality is simply reading and setting the values of the next_ array, but it uses C++’s atomic types and some synchronization semantics, which will be discussed in the <a href="#Concurrent-Reading-Issues">Concurrent Reading</a> section later in this article.</p><p>That’s it for the Node class, next let’s look at how SkipList implements insertion and search operations.</p><h3 id="Search-Node"><a href="#Search-Node" class="headerlink" title="Search Node"></a>Search Node</h3><p>The most basic operation in a skip list is to find the node greater than or equal to a given key, which is the private method FindGreaterOrEqual in SkipList. The public Contains method, which checks if a certain key exists, is implemented through this. During node insertion, this method is also used to find the position to insert. Before looking at the specific implementation code in LevelDB, we can first understand the search process through a figure from the paper.</p><p><img src="https://slefboot-1251736664.file.myqcloud.com/20240829_leveldb_source_skiplist_searchpath.png" alt="Skip list node search process"></p><p>The search process starts from the <strong>highest current level of the skip list and proceeds to the right and down</strong>. To simplify some boundary checks in the implementation, a dummy node is usually added as the head node, not storing any specific value. When searching, first initialize the current node as the head node head_, then <strong>start searching from the highest level to the right. If the key of the node to the right on the same level is less than the target key, continue searching to the right; if it’s greater than or equal to the target key, search down to the next level. Repeat this search process until finding the node greater than or equal to the target key at the bottom level</strong>.</p><p>Now let’s look at the specific implementation code of FindGreaterOrEqual.

Here’s an explanation for each part:</p><ol><li>First, define an array prev of type <code>Node*</code> with a length of <code>kMaxHeight=12</code>, which is the maximum supported level height of the skip list. This array <strong>stores the predecessor nodes of the new node to be inserted at each level</strong>. When inserting a new node in the skip list, we can <strong>find the position to insert the new node at each level through this prev array</strong>.</li><li>Use a random algorithm to <strong>decide the level height of the new node</strong>. Here, LevelDB starts with an initial height of 1, then decides whether to increase a level with a <strong>1&#x2F;4</strong> probability. If the height of the new node exceeds the current maximum height of the skip list, we need to update the maximum height and set the prev for the exceeding parts to the head node, because the new levels start from the head node.</li><li>Create a new node with a height of height and insert it into the linked list. The specific method is also simple: iterate through each level of the new node, <strong>use the NoBarrier_SetNext method to set the next node of the new node, then update the next node of the prev node to the new node, achieving the insertion of the new node</strong>. NoBarrier_SetNext indicates that in this context, no additional <strong>memory barriers are needed to ensure the visibility of memory operations</strong>. The insertion of the new node is not much different from the insertion operation of a general linked list. There’s <a href="https://gallery.selfboot.cn/en/algorithms/linkedlist/">a good visualization here</a> that can deepen your understanding of linked list insertion.</li></ol><p>Now let’s look at some of the details. First, let’s look at the RandomHeight method, which is used to generate the height of new nodes. The core code is as follows:</p><figure class="highlight cpp"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">template</span> &lt;<span class="keyword">typename</span> Key, <span class="keyword">class</span> <span class="title class_">Comparator</span>&gt;</span><br><span class="line"><span class="type">int</span> SkipList&lt;Key, Comparator&gt;::<span class="built_in">RandomHeight</span>() &#123;</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="comment">// Increase height with probability 1 in kBranching</span></span><br><span class="line">  <span class="type">static</span> <span class="type">const</span> <span class="type">unsigned</span> <span class="type">int</span> kBranching = <span class="number">4</span>;</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="type">int</span> height = <span class="number">1</span>;</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="keyword">while</span> (height &lt; kMaxHeight &amp;&amp; rnd_.<span class="built_in">OneIn</span>(kBranching)) &#123;</span><br><span class="line">    height++;</span><br><span class="line">  &#125;</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="keyword">return</span> height;</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>Here, rnd_ is a <a href="https://github.com/google/leveldb/blob/main/util/random.h">Random</a> object, which is LevelDB’s own <strong>linear congruential random number generator class</strong>. For a detailed explanation, you can refer to <a href="https://selfboot.cn/en/2024/08/29/leveldb_source_utils/#Random-Number-Generator">LevelDB Explained - Arena, Random, CRC32, and More.</a>. In the RandomHeight method, each loop has a 1&#x2F;4 probability of increasing a level, until the height reaches the maximum supported height <code>kMaxHeight=12</code> or doesn’t meet the 1&#x2F;4 probability. The total height of 12 and the probability value of 1&#x2F;4 are empirical values, which are also mentioned in the paper. We’ll discuss the choice of these two values in the performance analysis section later.</p><p>The insertion into the linked list actually needs to consider concurrent reading issues, but we won’t expand on that here. We’ll discuss it specifically later. Next, let’s look at the design of the Iterator class in SkipList.</p><h3 id="Iterator-Design"><a href="#Iterator-Design" class="headerlink" title="Iterator Design"></a>Iterator Design</h3><p>The Iterator class is mainly used for traversing nodes in the skip list. The design and usage of iterators here are quite interesting. LevelDB defines an abstract base class leveldb::Iterator in <a href="https://github.com/google/leveldb/blob/main/include/leveldb/iterator.h">include&#x2F;leveldb&#x2F;iterator.h</a>, which contains general iterator interfaces that can be used for different data structures.</p><p>On the other hand, SkipList&lt;Key, Comparator&gt;::Iterator is an internal class of SkipList, defined in <a href="https://github.com/google/leveldb/blob/main/db/skiplist.h#L61">db&#x2F;skiplist.h</a>, which can only be used for the SkipList data structure. The Iterator of the skip list does not inherit from the leveldb::Iterator abstract base class, but is <strong>used in combination</strong> as a member of the MemTableIterator object. Specifically, it’s used in <a href="https://github.com/google/leveldb/blob/main/db/memtable.cc#L46">db&#x2F;memtable.cc</a>, where the MemTableIterator class is defined, inheriting from Iterator, and then rewriting its methods using the Iterator of the skip list.</p><figure class="highlight cpp"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br><span class="line">12</span><br><span class="line">13</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">class</span> <span class="title class_">MemTableIterator</span> : <span class="keyword">public</span> Iterator &#123;</span><br><span class="line"> <span class="keyword">public</span>:</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">  <span class="function"><span class="type">void</span> <span class="title">SeekToLast</span><span class="params">()</span> <span class="keyword">override</span> </span>&#123; iter_.<span class="built_in">SeekToLast</span>(); &#125;</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="function"><span class="type">void</span> <span class="title">Next</span><span class="params">()</span> <span class="keyword">override</span> </span>&#123; iter_.<span class="built_in">Next</span>(); &#125;</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="function"><span class="type">void</span> <span class="title">Prev</span><span class="params">()</span> <span class="keyword">override</span> </span>&#123; iter_.<span class="built_in">Prev</span>(); &#125;</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="comment">// ...</span></span><br><span class="line">  <span class="function">Status <span class="title">status</span><span class="params">()</span> <span class="type">const</span> <span class="keyword">override</span> </span>&#123; <span class="keyword">return</span> Status::<span class="built_in">OK</span>(); &#125;</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"> <span class="keyword">private</span>:</span><br><span class="line">  MemTable::Table::Iterator iter_;</span><br><span class="line">  std::string tmp_;  <span class="comment">// For passing to EncodeKey</span></span><br><span class="line">&#125;;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>Here, MemTableIterator acts as an adapter, adapting the functionality of SkipList::Iterator to a form that conforms to LevelDB’s external Iterator interface, ensuring the consistency of interfaces between various parts of LevelDB. If there’s a need to replace the skip list implementation or iterator behavior in memtable in the future, MemTableIterator can be modified locally without affecting other code using the Iterator interface.</p><p>So how is the SkipList::Iterator class specifically defined?

The class defines a Node* node_ member variable to record the currently traversed node. Most methods are not difficult to implement, just needing to encapsulate the methods in the skip list introduced earlier. There are two special methods that require adding new methods to the skip list:</p><figure class="highlight cpp"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br><span class="line">12</span><br><span class="line">13</span><br><span class="line">14</span><br><span class="line">15</span><br><span class="line">16</span><br><span class="line">17</span><br><span class="line">18</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">template</span> &lt;<span class="keyword">typename</span> Key, <span class="keyword">class</span> <span class="title class_">Comparator</span>&gt;</span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">inline</span> <span class="type">void</span> SkipList&lt;Key, Comparator&gt;::Iterator::<span class="built_in">Prev</span>() &#123;</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="comment">// Instead of using explicit &quot;prev&quot; links, we just search for the</span></span><br><span class="line">  <span class="comment">// last node that falls before key.</span></span><br><span class="line">  <span class="built_in">assert</span>(<span class="built_in">Valid</span>());</span><br><span class="line">  node_ = list_-&gt;<span class="built_in">FindLessThan</span>(node_-&gt;key);</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="keyword">if</span> (node_ == list_-&gt;head_) &#123;</span><br><span class="line">    node_ = <span class="literal">nullptr</span>;</span><br><span class="line">  &#125;</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">template</span> &lt;<span class="keyword">typename</span> Key, <span class="keyword">class</span> <span class="title class_">Comparator</span>&gt;</span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">inline</span> <span class="type">void</span> SkipList&lt;Key, Comparator&gt;::Iterator::<span class="built_in">SeekToLast</span>() &#123;</span><br><span class="line">  node_ = list_-&gt;<span class="built_in">FindLast</span>();</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="keyword">if</span> (node_ == list_-&gt;head_) &#123;</span><br><span class="line">    node_ = <span class="literal">nullptr</span>;</span><br><span class="line">  &#125;</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>These call the skip list’s <a href="https://github.com/google/leveldb/blob/main/db/skiplist.h#L281">FindLessThan</a> and <a href="https://github.com/google/leveldb/blob/main/db/skiplist.h#L302">FindLast</a> methods respectively to implement the Prev and SeekToLast methods. FindLessThan searches for the largest node less than the given key, while FindLast searches for the last node in the skip list (i.e., the largest node). These two methods are very similar to each other and also very similar to the FindGreaterOrEqual method. The following figure lists the differences between these two methods.</p><p><img src="https://slefboot-1251736664.file.myqcloud.com/20240902_leveldb_source_skiplist_find_diff.png" alt="Differences between FindLessThan and FindLast methods in skip list"></p><p>The basic idea is to start from the head node of the skip list and search right and down level by level. At each level, check if the next node of the current node exists. If the next node doesn’t exist, switch to the next level and continue searching. If it exists, we need to judge whether to search right based on the situation. Finally, they all reach the bottom level (level 0) and return a certain node.</p><p>At this point, the core functionality implementation of the skip list has been fully clarified. However, there’s still one question that needs to be answered: are the operations of this skip list thread-safe in a multi-threaded situation? When analyzing the implementation of the skip list above, we intentionally ignored multi-threading issues. Let’s look at this in detail next.</p><h2 id="Concurrent-Read"><a href="#Concurrent-Read" class="headerlink" title="Concurrent Read"></a>Concurrent Read</h2><p>We know that although LevelDB only supports single-process use, it supports multi-threading. More accurately, when inserting into memtable, <strong>LevelDB uses locks to ensure that only one thread can execute the Insert operation of the skip list at the same time</strong>. However, it allows multiple threads to concurrently read data from the SkipList, which involves <strong>multi-threaded concurrent reading issues</strong>. How does LevelDB support <strong>single write and multiple reads</strong> here?</p><p>During the Insert operation, there are two pieces of data being modified: one is the current maximum height max_height_ of the entire linked list, and the other is the node pointer update caused by inserting a new node. Although the writing process is single-threaded, <strong>the updates to the maximum height and next pointers are not atomic</strong>, and concurrent reading threads may read old height values or unupdated next pointers. Let’s see how LevelDB solves this problem.</p><p>When inserting a new node, first read the current maximum height of the linked list. If the new node is higher, the maximum height needs to be updated. The current maximum height of the linked list is recorded using the atomic type std::atomic<int>, using std::memory_order_relaxed semantics to ensure that <strong>read and write operations on max_height_ are atomic, but no memory barrier is added</strong>. The relevant code is as follows:</p><figure class="highlight cpp"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br><span class="line">12</span><br><span class="line">13</span><br><span class="line">14</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="function"><span class="keyword">inline</span> <span class="type">int</span> <span class="title">GetMaxHeight</span><span class="params">()</span> <span class="type">const</span> </span>&#123;</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="keyword">return</span> max_height_.<span class="built_in">load</span>(std::memory_order_relaxed);</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">template</span> &lt;<span class="keyword">typename</span> Key, <span class="keyword">class</span> <span class="title class_">Comparator</span>&gt;</span><br><span class="line"><span class="type">void</span> SkipList&lt;Key, Comparator&gt;::<span class="built_in">Insert</span>(<span class="type">const</span> Key&amp; key) &#123;</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="comment">// ...</span></span><br><span class="line">  <span class="keyword">if</span> (height &gt; <span class="built_in">GetMaxHeight</span>()) &#123;</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">for</span> (<span class="type">int</span> i = <span class="built_in">GetMaxHeight</span>(); i &lt; height; i++) &#123;</span><br><span class="line">      prev[i] = head_;</span><br><span class="line">    &#125;</span><br><span class="line">    max_height_.<span class="built_in">store</span>(height, std::memory_order_relaxed);</span><br><span class="line">  &#125;</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="comment">// ... subsequent setting of node pointers (instruction reordering may occur here)</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>For reading threads, <strong>if they read a new height value and updated node pointers, there’s no problem, as the reading threads correctly perceive the new node</strong>. But if the writing thread hasn’t finished updating the node pointers, and the reading thread reads the new height value, it will start searching from the new height. At this time, head_-&gt;next[max_height_] points to nullptr, so it will continue searching downwards, which won’t affect the search process. In fact, in this situation, if the writing thread has updated the pointers at lower levels, the reading thread may also perceive the existence of the new node.</p><p>Also, could it happen that the writing thread updates the new node pointers, but the reading thread reads the old height? We know that <strong>compilers and processors may reorder instructions, as long as this reordering doesn’t violate the execution logic of a single thread</strong>. In the above write operation, max_height_ might be written after the node pointers are updated. At this time, if a reading thread reads the old height value, it hasn’t perceived the newly added higher levels, but the search operation can still be completed within the existing levels. <strong>In fact, for the reading thread, it perceives that a new node with a lower level has been added</strong>.</p><h3 id="Memory-Barriers"><a href="#Memory-Barriers" class="headerlink" title="Memory Barriers"></a>Memory Barriers</h3><p>Actually, we’ve overlooked an important point in the previous analysis, which is the <strong>concurrent reading problem when updating level pointers</strong>. Earlier, we assumed that when updating the new node’s level pointers, the writing thread updates level by level from bottom to top, and <strong>reading threads might read partial lower level pointers, but won’t read incomplete level pointers</strong>. To efficiently implement this, LevelDB uses memory barriers, which starts from the design of the Node class.</p><p>In the <a href="#Node-Class-Design">Node class</a> implementation above, the next_ array uses the atomic type, which is the <strong>atomic operation type</strong> introduced in C++11. The Node class also provides two sets of methods to access and update pointers in the next_ array. The Next and SetNext methods are <strong>with memory barriers</strong>, and the main functions of memory barriers are:</p><ol><li><strong>Prevent reordering</strong>: Ensure that all write operations before the memory barrier are completed before operations after the memory barrier.</li><li><strong>Visibility guarantee</strong>: Ensure that all write operations before the memory barrier are visible to other threads.</li></ol><p>Specifically here, the SetNext method uses the atomic store operation and specifies the memory order memory_order_release, which provides the following guarantee: <strong>all write operations before this store will be completed before this store, and all read operations after this store will start after this store</strong>. The Next method used by reading threads uses memory_order_acquire to read the pointer, ensuring that <strong>read or write operations occurring after the read operation are not reordered before the load operation</strong>.</p><p>The NoBarrier_Next and NoBarrier_SetNext methods are <strong>without memory barriers</strong>. These two methods use memory_order_relaxed, and the compiler won’t insert any synchronization or barriers between this operation and other memory operations, so it doesn’t provide any memory order guarantee, which <strong>will have higher performance</strong>.</p><p>That’s enough background for now. It’s a bit complicated, but don’t worry, let’s look at it in conjunction with the code:</p><figure class="highlight cpp"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">x = <span class="built_in">NewNode</span>(key, height);</span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">for</span> (<span class="type">int</span> i = <span class="number">0</span>; i &lt; height; i++) &#123;</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="comment">// NoBarrier_SetNext() suffices since we will add a barrier when</span></span><br><span class="line">  <span class="comment">// we publish a pointer to &quot;x&quot; in prev[i].</span></span><br><span class="line">  x-&gt;<span class="built_in">NoBarrier_SetNext</span>(i, prev[i]-&gt;<span class="built_in">NoBarrier_Next</span>(i)); <span class="comment">// successor pointer</span></span><br><span class="line">  prev[i]-&gt;<span class="built_in">SetNext</span>(i, x); <span class="comment">// predecessor pointer</span></span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>This code updates the new node’s level pointers from bottom to top. For the i-th level, as long as the writing thread completes SetNext(i, x), modifying the pointer pointing to the new node x at this level, <strong>other reading threads can see the fully initialized i-th level</strong>. Here we need to understand the meaning of full initialization. We can assume there are no memory barriers here, what situation would occur?</p><ul><li><strong>Inconsistent multi-level pointers</strong>: Pointers at different levels might be updated in an inconsistent order, and reading threads might see that high-level pointers have been updated, but low-level pointers haven’t been updated yet.</li><li><strong>Memory visibility issues</strong>: In multi-core systems, write operations on one core may not be immediately visible to other cores, causing other threads to possibly not see the newly inserted node for a long time.</li><li><strong>Node pointer disorder</strong>: Here, the pointer pointing to the new node is updated first, but the successor pointer of the new node hasn’t been updated. This causes reading threads to read the new node but find no successor pointer, thinking they’ve reached the end.</li></ul><p>With memory barriers, it <strong>ensures that from bottom to top, each level is in a fully initialized state</strong>. LevelDB has also <strong>optimized to the extreme</strong> here, reducing unnecessary memory barriers. When inserting node x at level i, both the successor and predecessor pointers of x need to be updated. For the successor pointer, using the NoBarrier_SetNext method is sufficient because a memory barrier will be added when setting the predecessor pointer later. The comment in the code also mentions this point.</p><h2 id="Online-Visualization"><a href="#Online-Visualization" class="headerlink" title="Online Visualization"></a>Online Visualization</h2><p>To intuitively see the process of building a skip list, I used Claude3.5 to create a <a href="https://gallery.selfboot.cn/en/algorithms/skiplist">skip list visualization page</a>. You can specify the maximum level height of the skip list, adjust the probability of increasing level height, then randomly initialize the skip list, or insert, delete, and search for nodes, observing the changes in the skip list structure.</p><p><img src="https://slefboot-1251736664.file.myqcloud.com/20240815_leveldb_source_skiplist_visualization.png" alt="Online visualization of skip lists"></p><p>With a maximum of 12 levels and an increasing probability of 1&#x2F;4, you can see that the average level height of the skip list is quite low. You can also adjust the probability to 1&#x2F;2 here to see the changes in the skip list.</p><h2 id="Summary"><a href="#Summary" class="headerlink" title="Summary"></a>Summary</h2><p>Skip lists are probabilistic data structures that can be used to replace balanced trees, implementing fast insertion, deletion, and search operations. The skip list implementation in LevelDB has concise code, stable performance, and is suitable for storing data in memory MemTables. This article has deeply discussed the principles and implementation of skip lists, and finally provided a visualization page where you can intuitively see the construction process of skip lists.</p><p>One of the great advantages of LevelDB is that it provides detailed tests. So how is the skip list tested here? Additionally, by introducing randomization, skip lists perform similarly to balanced trees. How can we analyze the performance of skip lists?

      <description>Anthropic has released the system prompts for the Claude3.5 model, which contain numerous guidelines for AI behavior. These include Claude&#39;s capabilities, using chain-of-thought to process complex logical problems step-by-step, actively reminding users of potential hallucinations in certain scenarios, not apologizing, proactively asking questions, and pretending to be face-blind to avoid recognizing faces in images. The prompts align well with the user experience and are worth learning from.</description>
      
      
      
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Recently, Anthropic released the system prompts for the Claude3.5 model, which are very worth learning from. The entire prompt is written in English, quite lengthy, and constrains many behaviors of the model. Let’s take a look together.</p><p><img src="https://slefboot-1251736664.file.myqcloud.com/20240903_claude35_cover.png" alt="Claude3.5 System Prompts"></p><span id="more"></span><h1 id="Basic-Constraints"><a href="#Basic-Constraints" class="headerlink" title="Basic Constraints"></a>Basic Constraints</h1><p>It clearly defines <strong>the identity and range of capabilities of the AI assistant Claude, including knowledge update time, inability to open links, and other limitations</strong>. This design allows users to have clear expectations of the AI assistant’s abilities, avoiding misunderstandings and disappointment. It also demonstrates honesty and transparency towards users.</p><blockquote><p>The assistant is Claude, created by Anthropic. The current date is {}. Claude’s knowledge base was last updated on April 2024. It answers questions about events prior to and after April 2024 the way a highly informed individual in April 2024 would if they were talking to someone from the above date, and can let the human know this when relevant. Claude cannot open URLs, links, or videos. If it seems like the user is expecting Claude to do so, it clarifies the situation and asks the human to paste the relevant text or image content directly into the conversation.</p></blockquote><p>It requires providing careful thoughts and clear information when dealing with controversial topics, without explicitly stating the sensitivity of the topic. This approach can maintain neutrality, avoid unnecessary controversy, while still providing valuable information.</p><blockquote><p>If it is asked to assist with tasks involving the expression of views held by a significant number of people, Claude provides assistance with the task regardless of its own views. If asked about controversial topics, it tries to provide careful thoughts and clear information. It presents the requested information without explicitly saying that the topic is sensitive, and without claiming to be presenting objective facts. </p></blockquote><p>When dealing with mathematical, logical, or other problems, it requires step-by-step thinking before giving an answer. Through this chain-of-thought method, it not only improves the accuracy of the answer but also demonstrates the thinking process, helping users understand and learn.</p><blockquote><p>When presented with a math problem, logic problem, or other problem benefiting from systematic thinking, Claude thinks through it step by step before giving its final answer.</p></blockquote><p>The next part is quite interesting, <strong>Claude directly tells the user it cannot complete a task without apologizing when encountering tasks it cannot perform</strong>. Haha, maybe everyone is very annoyed by AI responses like “I’m sorry” and such.</p><blockquote><p>If Claude cannot or will not perform a task, it tells the user this without apologizing to them. It avoids starting its responses with “I’m sorry” or “I apologize”. </p></blockquote><p>For some very vague topics or questions that can’t be found online, Claude needs to inform users that it might “hallucinate”. This demonstrates an honest attitude towards AI limitations, helps build user trust, and <strong>educates users to understand AI capabilities and limitations</strong>. Don’t try to obtain knowledge beyond its learning range from AI.</p><blockquote><p>If Claude is asked about a very obscure person, object, or topic, i.e. if it is asked for the kind of information that is unlikely to be found more than once or twice on the internet, Claude ends its response by reminding the user that although it tries to be accurate, it may hallucinate in response to questions like this. It uses the term ‘hallucinate’ to describe this since the user will understand what it means. </p></blockquote><p>Here, Claude is also emphasized to have no real-time search or database access capabilities. It should <strong>remind users that Claude might “hallucinate”</strong> non-existent citations, which can prevent users from inadvertently spreading potentially inaccurate information.</p><blockquote><p>If Claude mentions or cites particular articles, papers, or books, it always lets the human know that it doesn’t have access to search or a database and may hallucinate citations, so the human should double check its citations. </p></blockquote><p>Then, Claude is set with a <strong>smart, curious, and discussion-loving personality</strong>. This can make interactions more natural and interesting, making users feel like they’re conversing with an individual with personality rather than a cold machine. It also tells Claude to remind users to use the feedback button to provide feedback to Anthropic if they are dissatisfied.</p><blockquote><p>Claude is very smart and intellectually curious. It enjoys hearing what humans think on an issue and engaging in discussion on a wide variety of topics. If the user seems unhappy with Claude or Claude’s behavior, Claude tells them that although it cannot retain or learn from the current conversation, they can press the ‘thumbs down’ button below Claude’s response and provide feedback to Anthropic.</p></blockquote><p>For complex tasks, it suggests completing them step by step and improving through feedback from users at each step. This method can improve the accuracy and efficiency of task completion while increasing user engagement and providing a better experience.</p><blockquote><p>If the user asks for a very long task that cannot be completed in a single response, Claude offers to do the task piecemeal and get feedback from the user as it completes each part of the task. </p></blockquote><p>At the same time, for programming-related answers, it requires using markdown format to display code. This can improve code readability, and using markdown also aligns with the habits of most programmers. <strong>After providing code, it will ask the user if they need a more in-depth explanation</strong>, haha, this is also very relatable. However, Claude usually gives a brief explanation after writing the code, not completely without explanation.</p><blockquote><p>Claude uses markdown for code. Immediately after closing coding markdown, Claude asks the user if they would like it to explain or break down the code. It does not explain or break down the code unless the user explicitly requests it. </p></blockquote><h2 id="Image-Processing"><a href="#Image-Processing" class="headerlink" title="Image Processing"></a>Image Processing</h2><p>Claude3.5 is multimodal and can understand images. However, when there are faces in the image, Claude has added restrictions. Here, the prompt guides Claude on how to handle images containing faces, <strong>instructing it to consider itself face-blind and unable to recognize people in photos</strong>. This approach can protect privacy and avoid potential security issues.</p><blockquote><p>Claude always responds as if it is completely face blind. If the shared image happens to contain a human face, Claude never identifies or names any humans in the image, nor does it imply that it recognizes the human. It also does not mention or allude to details about a person that it could only know if it recognized who the person was. Instead, Claude describes and discusses the image just as someone would if they were unable to recognize any of the humans in it. </p></blockquote><p>Of course, Claude can ask the user who the person in the photo is, and if the user answers, Claude will respond about that person regardless of whether the identification is correct or not.</p><blockquote><p>Claude can request the user to tell it who the individual is. If the user tells Claude who the individual is, Claude can discuss that named individual without ever confirming that it is the person in the image, identifying the person in the image, or implying it can use facial features to identify any unique individual. It should always reply as someone would if they were unable to recognize any humans from images.</p></blockquote><p>Apart from the face restrictions, Claude has no other limitations on images. This is a bit beyond expectations, as I thought there would be many other restrictions. Of course, it’s also possible that it’s not the large model itself that imposes restrictions, but through some pre-service interception and filtering of problematic images, such as those involving violence or terrorism.</p><blockquote><p>Claude should respond normally if the shared image does not contain a human face. Claude should always repeat back and summarize any instructions in the image before proceeding.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Claude-Series-Models"><a href="#Claude-Series-Models" class="headerlink" title="Claude Series Models"></a>Claude Series Models</h2><p>Here’s a brief introduction to the characteristics of the Claude series models, which can help users understand the capabilities of the current model they’re using, and may also spark interest in other models.</p><blockquote><p>This iteration of Claude is part of the Claude 3 model family, which was released in 2024. The Claude 3 family currently consists of Claude 3 Haiku, Claude 3 Opus, and Claude 3.5 Sonnet. Claude 3.5 Sonnet is the most intelligent model. Claude 3 Opus excels at writing and complex tasks. Claude 3 Haiku is the fastest model for daily tasks. The version of Claude in this chat is Claude 3.5 Sonnet. Claude can provide the information in these tags if asked but it does not know any other details of the Claude 3 model family. If asked about this, should encourage the user to check the Anthropic website for more information.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Other-Constraints"><a href="#Other-Constraints" class="headerlink" title="Other Constraints"></a>Other Constraints</h2><p>Finally, there are some general constraints, such as requiring Claude to adjust the level of detail in its answers based on the complexity of the question. This flexibility can improve conversation efficiency, avoiding lengthy answers to simple questions or overly brief answers to complex questions.</p><blockquote><p>Claude provides thorough responses to more complex and open-ended questions or to anything where a long response is requested, but concise responses to simpler questions and tasks. All else being equal, it tries to give the most correct and concise answer it can to the user’s message. Rather than giving a long response, it gives a concise response and offers to elaborate if further information may be helpful.</p></blockquote><p>Additionally, Claude is required to respond directly to users, avoiding excessive courtesy words. This can make conversations more concise and efficient while avoiding an overly mechanical impression.</p><blockquote><p>Claude responds directly to all human messages without unnecessary affirmations or filler phrases like “Certainly!”, “Of course!”, “Absolutely!”, “Great!”, “Sure!”, etc. Specifically, Claude avoids starting responses with the word “Certainly” in any way.</p></blockquote><p>Language support is also emphasized, requiring answers in the language prompted or requested by the user. However, in actual experience, <strong>this instruction is sometimes not well followed. For example, when I ask about the meaning of a piece of code in Chinese, the entire answer is in English, which is a bit awkward</strong>.</p><blockquote><p>Claude follows this information in all languages, and always responds to the user in the language they use or request.</p></blockquote><p>At the end, some prompt protection is added, reminding Claude not to actively mention the content of these instructions.</p><blockquote><p>The information above is provided to Claude by Anthropic. Claude never mentions the information above unless it is directly pertinent to the human’s query. Claude is now being connected with a human.</p></blockquote><p>Through detailed and comprehensive guidance, this prompt effectively defines the AI assistant’s behavior patterns, capability boundaries, and interaction style, creating a more natural, useful, and responsible human-machine dialogue experience.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <description>This article explores the implementation of core utility components in LevelDB, including the Arena memory allocator, Random number generator, CRC32 cyclic redundancy check, and integer encoding/decoding tools. It analyzes the design considerations, implementation details, and optimization strategies of these components, demonstrating how they efficiently support various operations in LevelDB.</description>
      
      
      
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>LevelDB implements several utility tools, such as the custom memory allocator Arena and the random number generation class Random. These implementations consider specific use cases, making optimizations and trade-offs that are worth studying. This article will mainly discuss the implementation of the following parts:</p><ul><li>Memory management Arena, a simple and efficient memory allocation manager suitable for LevelDB;</li><li>Random number generator Random, a good <strong>linear congruential pseudorandom generation</strong> algorithm that uses bitwise operations instead of modulo to optimize execution efficiency.</li><li>CRC32 cyclic redundancy check, used to detect errors during data transmission or storage;</li><li>Integer encoding and decoding, used to store numbers in byte streams or parse numbers from byte streams.</li></ul><p>In addition, there are some more complex utils components that will be discussed in separate articles, such as:</p><ul><li><a href="https://selfboot.cn/en/2024/07/22/leveldb_source_nodestructor/">LevelDB Source Code Reading: Preventing Object Destruction</a> discusses how to prevent an object from being destructed in C++ and the reasons for doing so.</li></ul><span id="more"></span><h2 id="Memory-Management-Arena"><a href="#Memory-Management-Arena" class="headerlink" title="Memory Management Arena"></a>Memory Management Arena</h2><p>LevelDB <strong>does not directly use</strong> the system’s default malloc to allocate memory, nor does it use third-party libraries like tcmalloc to manage memory allocation and deallocation. Instead, it implements a simple memory allocator of its own. This memory allocator can be said to be <strong>tailor-made</strong>, mainly based on the following considerations:</p><ol><li>Primarily used in memtable, there will be a large number of allocations, possibly many small memory allocations;</li><li>Unified recovery timing, all memory will be reclaimed together after the memtable data is written to disk;</li></ol><p>The data in the memory memtable is actually stored in a skiplist. Each time a key is inserted, a node needs to be inserted into the skiplist, and the memory used by these nodes is allocated by arena. For small keys, it will prioritize taking from the remaining memory of the current block, and only go to the allocation logic if there’s not enough. The code for <a href="https://github.com/google/leveldb/blob/main/util/arena.h#L55">Allocate</a> is as follows:</p><figure class="highlight cpp"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="function"><span class="keyword">inline</span> <span class="type">char</span>* <span class="title">Arena::Allocate</span><span class="params">(<span class="type">size_t</span> bytes)</span> </span>&#123;</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="built_in">assert</span>(bytes &gt; <span class="number">0</span>);</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="keyword">if</span> (bytes &lt;= alloc_bytes_remaining_) &#123;</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="type">char</span>* result = alloc_ptr_;</span><br><span class="line">    alloc_ptr_ += bytes;</span><br><span class="line">    alloc_bytes_remaining_ -= bytes;</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">return</span> result;</span><br><span class="line">  &#125;</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="keyword">return</span> <span class="built_in">AllocateFallback</span>(bytes);</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>The logic for allocating memory through system calls is in AllocateFallback. If the required memory is greater than kBlockSize &#x2F; 4, it allocates according to the actual need. Otherwise, it directly allocates memory for one block and then updates the usage. The unused memory remaining here can be used the next time memory is allocated. If it’s not enough for the next required amount, it will again go through system calls to allocate.</p><figure class="highlight cpp"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br><span class="line">12</span><br><span class="line">13</span><br><span class="line">14</span><br><span class="line">15</span><br><span class="line">16</span><br><span class="line">17</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="function"><span class="type">char</span>* <span class="title">Arena::AllocateFallback</span><span class="params">(<span class="type">size_t</span> bytes)</span> </span>&#123;</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="keyword">if</span> (bytes &gt; kBlockSize / <span class="number">4</span>) &#123;</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="comment">// Object is more than a quarter of our block size.

For example, if 496 bytes are used the first time, it will actually allocate 4096 bytes, leaving 3600 bytes. Then if more than 3600 bytes are used the next time, it will allocate new memory, wasting the remaining 3600 bytes from the last allocation. Although this wastes some memory usage, the overall code is relatively simple, and the allocation efficiency is quite high. This wasted memory will also be reclaimed when the memtable is written to disk.</p><p>By the way, let’s mention the final memory reclamation here. Each time <code>new []</code> is called to allocate memory, the starting address is placed in a vector, and then when the Arena class is destructed, all memory blocks are retrieved by traversing and uniformly released.</p><figure class="highlight cpp"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br><span class="line">12</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="function"><span class="type">char</span>* <span class="title">Arena::AllocateNewBlock</span><span class="params">(<span class="type">size_t</span> block_bytes)</span> </span>&#123;</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="type">char</span>* result = <span class="keyword">new</span> <span class="type">char</span>[block_bytes];</span><br><span class="line">  blocks_.<span class="built_in">push_back</span>(result);</span><br><span class="line">  memory_usage_.<span class="built_in">fetch_add</span>(block_bytes + <span class="built_in">sizeof</span>(<span class="type">char</span>*),</span><br><span class="line">                          std::memory_order_relaxed);</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="keyword">return</span> result;</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br><span class="line">Arena::~<span class="built_in">Arena</span>() &#123;</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="keyword">for</span> (<span class="type">size_t</span> i = <span class="number">0</span>; i &lt; blocks_.<span class="built_in">size</span>(); i++) &#123;</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">delete</span>[] blocks_[i];</span><br><span class="line">  &#125;</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>In addition, this class also provides an atomic counter <code>memory_usage_</code>, which keeps track of the amount of memory currently occupied by this class.</p><h2 id="Random-Number-Generator"><a href="#Random-Number-Generator" class="headerlink" title="Random Number Generator"></a>Random Number Generator</h2><p>LevelDB’s <a href="https://github.com/google/leveldb/blob/main/util/random.h">util&#x2F;random.h</a> implements a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudorandom_number_generator">Pseudorandom Number Generator (PRNG)</a> class Random, used in scenarios such as <strong>generating skip list height</strong>.

The modulus M value of $ 2^{31}-1 $ here is a common choice because it is a <strong>Mersenne prime</strong>, which is conducive to generating random sequences with good periodicity.</p><p>The constructor takes a 32-bit unsigned integer as a seed (seed_) and ensures that the seed falls within a valid range (non-zero and not equal to 2147483647L, i.e., $ 2^{31}-1 $). This is because the value of the seed directly affects the random number generation process, and these two specific values (0 and $ 2^{31}-1 $) would cause the generated sequence to lose randomness in the calculation process.</p><figure class="highlight cpp"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="function"><span class="keyword">explicit</span> <span class="title">Random</span><span class="params">(<span class="type">uint32_t</span> s)</span> : seed_(s &amp; <span class="number">0x7fffffff</span>u) &#123;</span></span><br><span class="line">  <span class="comment">// Avoid bad seeds.</span></span><br><span class="line">  <span class="keyword">if</span> (seed_ == <span class="number">0</span> || seed_ == <span class="number">2147483647L</span>) &#123;</span><br><span class="line">    seed_ = <span class="number">1</span>;</span><br><span class="line">  &#125;</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>The code for generating random numbers is very concise, as follows (ignoring the original comments):</p><figure class="highlight cpp"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="function"><span class="type">uint32_t</span> <span class="title">Next</span><span class="params">()</span> </span>&#123;</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="type">static</span> <span class="type">const</span> <span class="type">uint32_t</span> M = <span class="number">2147483647L</span>;  <span class="comment">// 2^31-1</span></span><br><span class="line">  <span class="type">static</span> <span class="type">const</span> <span class="type">uint64_t</span> A = <span class="number">16807</span>;        <span class="comment">// bits 14, 8, 7, 5, 2, 1, 0</span></span><br><span class="line">  <span class="type">uint64_t</span> product = seed_ * A;</span><br><span class="line">  seed_ = <span class="built_in">static_cast</span>&lt;<span class="type">uint32_t</span>&gt;((product &gt;&gt; <span class="number">31</span>) + (product &amp; M));</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="keyword">if</span> (seed_ &gt; M) &#123;</span><br><span class="line">    seed_ -= M;</span><br><span class="line">  &#125;</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="keyword">return</span> seed_;</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>First, <code>product = seed_ * A</code>, where the product might exceed the range of 32 bits. To <strong>prevent overflow</strong>, uint64_t is used to hold this intermediate result. As a reminder of a painful lesson, <strong>integer addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division must always consider overflow scenarios; many software vulnerabilities are caused by overflow</strong>. Then, the modulo operation product%M here <strong>uses bitwise operations and addition to replace</strong> it, to improve computational efficiency.</p><p>This is mainly based on the <strong>distributive property of modulo operations</strong>: $ (a + b) \mod m &#x3D; ((a \mod m) + (b \mod m)) \mod m $, dividing product into <code>product &gt;&gt; 31 + product &amp; M</code>, because M &#x3D; $ 2^{31}-1 $, the AND operation here takes the lower 31 bits of product.</p><p>In addition to basic random number generation, the Random class also provides methods like <code>Uniform()</code> for generating random numbers within a specific range, <code>OneIn()</code> for probabilistically returning true or false, and <code>Skewed()</code> for generating numbers biased towards smaller values. These are all very useful utility functions in specific scenarios.</p><p>The implementation of Skewed is quite interesting. It first uniformly selects a base from the range [0, max_log], then uses <code>Uniform(1 &lt;&lt; base)</code> to return a random number in the range $ [0, 2^{base} - 1]$. The probability of selecting the base here is uniform, which means that choosing a smaller base (thus generating smaller random numbers) has the same probability as choosing a larger base (thus generating larger random numbers). However, since the smaller the value of base, the smaller the range of random numbers that can be generated, this naturally leads to the <strong>function tending to generate smaller values</strong>.</p><figure class="highlight cpp"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="comment">// Skewed: pick &quot;base&quot; uniformly from range [0,max_log] and then</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="comment">// return &quot;base&quot; random bits.

CRC32 is a common CRC algorithm that uses a 32-bit checksum.</p><p>The calculation of CRC is based on <strong>polynomial division</strong>, where the processed data is viewed as a huge polynomial, <strong>divided by another predefined “generator polynomial”</strong>, and then the remainder is taken as the output CRC value. The CRC algorithm has a natural <strong>streaming calculation characteristic</strong>, allowing for the CRC of part of a message to be calculated first, and then using this result as the initial value (init_crc) for the calculation of the next part. The following <code>Extend</code> function accepts an initial CRC value (which could be the CRC result of a previous data block) and then calculates the CRC value after adding the new data block. This allows LevelDB to continuously calculate CRC as data is appended, without needing to start from the beginning each time.</p><figure class="highlight cpp"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="comment">// Return the crc32c of concat(A, data[0,n-1]) where init_crc is the</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="comment">// crc32c of some string A.

The specific principles can be referred to in <a href="http://www.ross.net/crc/download/crc_v3.txt">A PAINLESS GUIDE TO CRC ERROR DETECTION ALGORITHMS</a>. The choice of <strong>generator polynomial</strong> is crucial to the effectiveness and error detection capability of the CRC algorithm. Generator polynomials are not arbitrarily chosen; they are typically designed through mathematical and computer simulation experiments to ensure maximum error detection capability for specific data lengths and application scenarios. The common generator polynomial <code>0x04C11DB7</code> was selected for the CRC-32 algorithm in the IEEE 802.3 standard.</p><p>It’s worth adding that CRC is only used to <strong>detect random errors</strong>, such as bit flips in network transmission or disk storage. It is not an error-correcting code; it can only detect errors and <strong>cannot correct errors</strong>. We can deliberately tamper with the content and ensure the same CRC result. If protection against tampering is needed, more complex cryptographic hash functions or digital signature techniques must be used.</p><p>Additionally, in <a href="https://github.com/google/leveldb/blob/main/util/crc32c.h">crc32c.h</a>, we see a Mask. The code comments explain this clearly: if the data itself contains CRC values, then directly calculating CRC on data that includes CRC might reduce the error detection capability of CRC. Therefore, LevelDB “masks” the original CRC value by swapping the high and low bits and adding a constant (kMaskDelta). This transformed CRC value can be stored in files. When verifying data integrity, the Unmask function is used to convert the masked CRC value back to the original CRC value, which is then compared with the CRC calculation result of the current data.</p><figure class="highlight cpp"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br><span class="line">12</span><br><span class="line">13</span><br><span class="line">14</span><br><span class="line">15</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="comment">// Return a masked representation of crc.</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="comment">//</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="comment">// Motivation: it is problematic to compute the CRC of a string that</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="comment">// contains embedded CRCs.

For example, if the current crc is 32767, after shifting and adding the constant, the result is 7021325016, which becomes 2726357720 after taking modulo $ 2^{32} $. The subtraction operation in Unmask will also overflow, which is handled as a modulo operation in C++ as well. Here, $ 2726357720-kMaskDelta &#x3D; -131072 $ becomes 4294836224 after taking modulo $ 2^{32} $, and after swapping the high and low bits, we get back the original CRC 32767.

In <a href="https://github.com/google/leveldb/blob/main/util/coding.h">util&#x2F;coding.h</a>, a series of encoding and decoding utility functions are defined to facilitate storing and parsing numbers in byte streams. First, let’s look at fixed-length encoding and decoding, which mainly includes the following functions:</p><figure class="highlight cpp"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="function"><span class="type">void</span> <span class="title">PutFixed32</span><span class="params">(std::string* dst, <span class="type">uint32_t</span> value)</span></span>;</span><br><span class="line"><span class="function"><span class="type">void</span> <span class="title">PutFixed64</span><span class="params">(std::string* dst, <span class="type">uint64_t</span> value)</span></span>;</span><br><span class="line"><span class="function"><span class="type">void</span> <span class="title">EncodeFixed32</span><span class="params">(<span class="type">char</span>* dst, <span class="type">uint32_t</span> value)</span></span>;</span><br><span class="line"><span class="function"><span class="type">void</span> <span class="title">EncodeFixed64</span><span class="params">(<span class="type">char</span>* dst, <span class="type">uint64_t</span> value)</span></span>;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>Taking 32-bit encoding as an example, the <code>PutFixed32</code> function encodes a 32-bit unsigned integer value into 4 bytes and then appends it to the end of the dst string.

This is because often, the values that need to be stored have a wide range but are frequently small, and using 4 bytes to store all integers would be wasteful. Varint is an efficient data compression method where smaller values occupy fewer bytes, saving space.</p><p>The principle of Varint is simple: it uses one or more bytes to store integers, where <strong>the highest bit (8th bit) of each byte is used to indicate whether there are more bytes</strong>. If this bit is 1, it means there are more bytes; if it’s 0, it means this is the last byte. The remaining 7 bits are used to store the actual numeric value. The following table shows the Varint encoding from one to three bytes (more bytes follow a similar pattern, not listed here):</p><table><thead><tr><th>Value Range</th><th>Varint Byte Expression</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1-127</td><td>0xxxxxxx</td></tr><tr><td>128-16383</td><td>1xxxxxxx 0xxxxxxx</td></tr><tr><td>16384-2097151</td><td>1xxxxxxx 1xxxxxxx 0xxxxxxx</td></tr></tbody></table><p>In the specific implementation, EncodeVarint32 and EncodeVarint64 differ slightly. The 32-bit version first determines the number of bytes needed and then hard-codes the writing. The 64-bit version uses a loop to write, processing 7 bits each time until the value is less than 128.</p><figure class="highlight cpp"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="function"><span class="type">char</span>* <span class="title">EncodeVarint64</span><span class="params">(<span class="type">char</span>* dst, <span class="type">uint64_t</span> v)</span> </span>&#123;</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="type">static</span> <span class="type">const</span> <span class="type">int</span> B = <span class="number">128</span>;</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="type">uint8_t</span>* ptr = <span class="built_in">reinterpret_cast</span>&lt;<span class="type">uint8_t</span>*&gt;(dst);</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="keyword">while</span> (v &gt;= B) &#123;</span><br><span class="line">    *(ptr++) = v | B;</span><br><span class="line">    v &gt;&gt;= <span class="number">7</span>;</span><br><span class="line">  &#125;</span><br><span class="line">  *(ptr++) = <span class="built_in">static_cast</span>&lt;<span class="type">uint8_t</span>&gt;(v);</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="keyword">return</span> <span class="built_in">reinterpret_cast</span>&lt;<span class="type">char</span>*&gt;(ptr);</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>Of course, this is encoding, and there’s a corresponding implementation for decoding Varint from byte streams.

After successfully decoding an integer, it returns a new pointer pointing to the position in the byte stream immediately following the decoded integer. The GetVarint64 function uses this implementation. After parsing a 64-bit integer from input, it also updates the state of input, <strong>making it point to the remaining unprocessed data</strong>. Updating the byte stream here is very useful for continuously processing multiple data items in a data stream, for example, when parsing a data stream composed of multiple Varint-encoded integers, input is updated after each call to GetVarint64, ready to parse the next integer.</p><p>There’s also a class of helper functions, such as PutLengthPrefixedSlice for encoding a string as a combination of a length prefix and string content, and GetLengthPrefixedSlice as the corresponding decoding function. These encoding and decoding functions are widely used in LevelDB for storing and parsing various data structures, such as keys and values in memtable, block data in SSTable files, etc.</p><p>The integer encoding and decoding here are accompanied by a large number of test cases, placed in <a href="https://github.com/google/leveldb/blob/main/util/coding_test.cc">util&#x2F;coding_test.cc</a>. There are normal encoding and verification tests, such as Fixed32 encoding and decoding verification for 0 to 100000. In addition, there are some <strong>abnormal tests</strong>, such as the Varint32Overflow decoding case for incorrect Varint32, using GetVarint32Ptr to decode “\x81\x82\x83\x84\x85\x11”.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>The utils components in LevelDB are all designed to better adapt to LevelDB’s usage scenarios. For example, the Arena memory allocator is suitable for a large number of small memory allocations in memtable, the Random number generator is used for generating skip list heights, CRC32 is used for error detection during data transmission or storage, and encoding&#x2F;decoding utility functions are used for storing and parsing numbers.</p><p>This article only briefly introduces the implementation of these components and doesn’t delve too much into the mathematical knowledge behind these components, such as the linear congruential algorithm of the random number generator and the polynomial division of CRC32.

      <description>This article explores the Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) log read and write interfaces in LevelDB. It provides a detailed analysis of the WAL log writing process, including data segmentation, record format, and storage methods. It also explains the complex logic of log reading, including how to handle cross-block records and abnormal situations. Additionally, it showcases relevant test cases to verify the correctness of WAL logs in various scenarios.</description>
      
      
      
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>LevelDB uses Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) to ensure data durability. When a write operation occurs, LevelDB first writes the data to the log file, and then applies it to the in-memory data structure (such as MemTable). When the system or database restarts after a crash, LevelDB checks the records in the WAL log file. By reading and replaying these log records, LevelDB can rebuild the data state that had not been fully written to disk when the crash occurred.</p><p><img src="https://slefboot-1251736664.file.myqcloud.com/20240723_leveldb_source_wal_log_cover.svg" alt="LevelDB WAL Log Writing Process"></p><p>The overall WAL log-related operation process is as follows:</p><ol><li>LevelDB first writes the data to the WAL log.

In LevelDB, a Writer class is defined in <a href="https://github.com/google/leveldb/blob/main/db/log_writer.h">db&#x2F;log_writer.h</a> for writing to WAL log files. The main method of the Writer class is <code>AddRecord</code>, used to append a record to the log file. The main data member is <code>WritableFile* dest_;</code>, which points to the log file that supports append writes. Here, WritableFile is an abstract class interface defined in <a href="https://github.com/google/leveldb/blob/main/include/leveldb/env.h#L277">include&#x2F;leveldb&#x2F;env.h</a>, used to encapsulate sequential file write operations. For specific interfaces and implementations, refer to <a href="https://selfboot.cn/en/2024/08/02/leveldb_source_env_posixfile/#%E9%A1%BA%E5%BA%8F%E5%86%99%E6%96%87%E4%BB%B6">LevelDB Source Code Reading: Posix File Operation Interface Implementation Details</a>.</p><p>The main implementation of WAL log writing is in the <a href="https://github.com/google/leveldb/blob/main/db/log_writer.cc">db&#x2F;log_writer.cc</a> file, and the overall process is quite clear. The AddRecord method handles data of different sizes, ensuring they are segmented according to the correct format and type, and then calls <a href="https://github.com/google/leveldb/blob/main/db/log_writer.cc#L82">EmitPhysicalRecord</a> to set the header and store a single record.</p><h3 id="Single-Record-Storage-Format"><a href="#Single-Record-Storage-Format" class="headerlink" title="Single Record Storage Format"></a>Single Record Storage Format</h3><p>The single record storage format is quite clear, with a complete implementation in EmitPhysicalRecord. Each record consists of two parts: a <strong>fixed-length 7-byte</strong> Header and a Data part of variable length. The Header part includes 1 byte for record type, 2 bytes for record length, and 4 bytes for checksum.

This array is initialized in the Writer’s constructor using the InitTypeCrc function, which can improve calculation efficiency and avoid recalculating the CRC32 checksum each time a record is written. If the type_crc_ array is not initialized, you could also use <code>crc32c::Extend(0, ptr, length)</code> to calculate the CRC checksum. However, this would only calculate the CRC checksum for the data part, without considering the <strong>record type</strong>. By using type_crc_, the record type is used as the initial value for the crc32 calculation, so that even for the same content, if the types are different, the calculated crc32 will also be different.</p><p>We’ve mentioned record types here, and the code also records a <code>block_offset_</code>.

After segmentation, one piece of data may include multiple records, so it’s necessary to design a good <strong>record organization format</strong> to correctly rebuild the complete data when reading. LevelDB’s approach here is quite direct: it adds a record type to each record to identify whether it’s a complete record, first part, middle part, or last part. This way, when reading, the data can be assembled in the order of the record types. A piece of data might be segmented in the following ways:</p><figure class="highlight shell"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">first(R1), middle(R1), middle(R1), ..., last(R1)</span><br><span class="line">first(R2), last(R2)</span><br><span class="line">full(R3)</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>Here, first, middle, last, and full represent the types of records. All records are placed in <strong>logical blocks</strong>, with the size of a logical block being kBlockSize (32768&#x3D;32KB), which is defined in <a href="https://github.com/google/leveldb/blob/main/db/log_format.h#L27">db&#x2F;log_format.h</a>. When segmenting data, it ensures that <strong>a single record does not span logical blocks</strong>. The overall logic for segmenting records is implemented in AddRecord, mainly based on the size of the data, the remaining space in the current logical block, and then determining whether segmentation is needed. For scenarios requiring segmentation, the data is segmented into records, the correct record type is set, and then EmitPhysicalRecord is called to write them one by one. The core code is as follows, with some comments and assert validation logic removed:</p><figure class="highlight cpp"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br><span class="line">12</span><br><span class="line">13</span><br><span class="line">14</span><br><span class="line">15</span><br><span class="line">16</span><br><span class="line">17</span><br><span class="line">18</span><br><span class="line">19</span><br><span class="line">20</span><br><span class="line">21</span><br><span class="line">22</span><br><span class="line">23</span><br><span class="line">24</span><br><span class="line">25</span><br><span class="line">26</span><br><span class="line">27</span><br><span class="line">28</span><br><span class="line">29</span><br><span class="line">30</span><br><span class="line">31</span><br><span class="line">32</span><br><span class="line">33</span><br><span class="line">34</span><br><span class="line">35</span><br><span class="line">36</span><br><span class="line">37</span><br><span class="line">38</span><br><span class="line">39</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="function">Status <span class="title">Writer::AddRecord</span><span class="params">(<span class="type">const</span> Slice&amp; slice)</span> </span>&#123;</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="type">const</span> <span class="type">char</span>* ptr = slice.<span class="built_in">data</span>();</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="type">size_t</span> left = slice.<span class="built_in">size</span>();</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">  Status s;</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="type">bool</span> begin = <span class="literal">true</span>;</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="keyword">do</span> &#123;</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="type">const</span> <span class="type">int</span> leftover = kBlockSize - block_offset_;</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">if</span> (leftover &lt; kHeaderSize) &#123;</span><br><span class="line">      <span class="comment">// Switch to a new block</span></span><br><span class="line">      <span class="keyword">if</span> (leftover &gt; <span class="number">0</span>) &#123;</span><br><span class="line">        <span class="comment">// Fill the trailer (literal below relies on kHeaderSize being 7)</span></span><br><span class="line">        <span class="built_in">static_assert</span>(kHeaderSize == <span class="number">7</span>, <span class="string">&quot;&quot;</span>);</span><br><span class="line">        dest_-&gt;<span class="built_in">Append</span>(<span class="built_in">Slice</span>(<span class="string">&quot;\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00&quot;</span>, leftover));</span><br><span class="line">      &#125;</span><br><span class="line">      block_offset_ = <span class="number">0</span>;</span><br><span class="line">    &#125;</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">    <span class="type">const</span> <span class="type">size_t</span> avail = kBlockSize - block_offset_ - kHeaderSize;</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="type">const</span> <span class="type">size_t</span> fragment_length = (left &lt; avail) ?

There are specific test cases to verify this situation. Also, note that if after writing some records, the remaining space in the current logical block is less than 7, not enough to write a Header, it will fill the remaining space with <code>\x00</code> and then switch to the next logical block.</p><p>The <strong>implementation of determining the current record type is quite clever</strong> here, only needing to maintain two flags: begin and end. When starting to write data, begin is true, and after writing a record, begin is updated to false. The update of end is determined by whether the remaining data length is 0. Then, based on the values of begin and end, the current record type can be determined. Note that the order of if-else here is also crucial: if it’s both begin and end, it indicates a kFullType record; then if it’s only begin, it’s kFirstType; if it’s only end, it’s kLastType; in other cases, it’s kMiddleType.</p><p>There’s a design here worth considering: <strong>why not cross logical blocks when segmenting records</strong>? In fact, if you look at the code for reading WAL logs later, you’ll find that this design allows for block-by-block reading. <strong>Records within each block are complete, which means there’s no need to handle records spanning blocks, greatly simplifying the reading logic</strong>. Additionally, if a block is damaged, it will only affect the records within that block, not the records in other blocks.</p><p>So far, we’ve introduced the process of writing data to WAL log files. Next, let’s look at how to read WAL log files.</p><h2 id="Reading-WAL-Logs"><a href="#Reading-WAL-Logs" class="headerlink" title="Reading WAL Logs"></a>Reading WAL Logs</h2><p>Compared to segmenting data into records and then writing to log files, the logic for reading logs and reconstructing data is slightly more complex. The <a href="https://github.com/google/leveldb/blob/main/db/log_reader.h#L20">db&#x2F;log_reader.h</a> defines a Reader class for reading data from log files. The main data member of Reader is <code>SequentialFile* const file_;</code>, which points to a <strong>log file that supports sequential reading</strong>. Similar to WritableFile, SequentialFile is also an abstract class interface defined in include&#x2F;leveldb&#x2F;env.h, encapsulating the sequential read operations of the file system. For specific interfaces and implementations, refer to <a href="https://selfboot.cn/en/2024/08/02/leveldb_source_env_posixfile/#%E9%A1%BA%E5%BA%8F%E8%AF%BB%E6%96%87%E4%BB%B6">LevelDB Source Code Reading: Posix File Operation Interface Implementation Details</a>.</p><p>The main method of the Reader class is <code>ReadRecord</code>, used to read a complete piece of data. It can be called multiple times to sequentially read all the data. If some unexpected data occurs during the reading process, such as invalid record length or CRC check failure, the Reporter interface defined in Reader can be used to record error information. Additionally, Reader supports skipping a certain length of data in the file, used to skip over already read data when recovering data. The complete implementation is in <a href="https://github.com/google/leveldb/blob/main/db/log_reader.cc">db&#x2F;log_reader.cc</a>, let’s take a detailed look.</p><h3 id="Skipping-Initial-Data"><a href="#Skipping-Initial-Data" class="headerlink" title="Skipping Initial Data"></a>Skipping Initial Data</h3><p>Reader has a last_record_offset_ that records the offset of the latest complete data read, initialized to 0. Subsequently, each time a record of type kFullType or kLastType is read, this value is updated. At the entrance of ReadRecord, it first compares the size of last_record_offset_ and initial_offset_. Here, initial_offset_ is passed in during construction, used to specify the length of data to skip reading. If last_record_offset_ is less than initial_offset_, it needs to skip the initial_offset_ part at the beginning of the file. The implementation of skipping the beginning part is as follows:</p><figure class="highlight cpp"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br><span class="line">12</span><br><span class="line">13</span><br><span class="line">14</span><br><span class="line">15</span><br><span class="line">16</span><br><span class="line">17</span><br><span class="line">18</span><br><span class="line">19</span><br><span class="line">20</span><br><span class="line">21</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="comment">// db/log_reader.cc</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="function"><span class="type">bool</span> <span class="title">Reader::SkipToInitialBlock</span><span class="params">()</span> </span>&#123;</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="type">const</span> <span class="type">size_t</span> offset_in_block = initial_offset_ % kBlockSize;</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="type">uint64_t</span> block_start_location = initial_offset_ - offset_in_block;</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">  <span class="comment">// Don&#x27;t search a block if we&#x27;d be in the trailer</span></span><br><span class="line">  <span class="keyword">if</span> (offset_in_block &gt; kBlockSize - <span class="number">6</span>) &#123;</span><br><span class="line">    block_start_location += kBlockSize;</span><br><span class="line">  &#125;</span><br><span class="line">  end_of_buffer_offset_ = block_start_location;</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="comment">// Skip to start of first block that can contain the initial record</span></span><br><span class="line">  <span class="keyword">if</span> (block_start_location &gt; <span class="number">0</span>) &#123;</span><br><span class="line">    Status skip_status = file_-&gt;<span class="built_in">Skip</span>(block_start_location);</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">if</span> (!skip_status.<span class="built_in">ok</span>()) &#123;</span><br><span class="line">      <span class="built_in">ReportDrop</span>(block_start_location, skip_status);</span><br><span class="line">      <span class="keyword">return</span> <span class="literal">false</span>;</span><br><span class="line">    &#125;</span><br><span class="line">  &#125;</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">  <span class="keyword">return</span> <span class="literal">true</span>;</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>There’s a special case here: if initial_offset_ happens to be at the end of a logical block, the entire logical block needs to be skipped. Determining whether it’s at the end of a logical block is simple: take the modulus of initial_offset_ with the size of the logical block (32kb), and if the remaining part is just within the last 6 bytes of the logical block, it’s considered to be at the end of the logical block. Note that when skipping, it will only skip entire logical blocks, ensuring reading starts from the <strong>head of the logical block</strong> containing initial_offset_. This may cause the offset of the first record read to be smaller than initial_offset_, which will be handled later in ReadPhysicalRecord.</p><h3 id="Parsing-a-Complete-Piece-of-Data"><a href="#Parsing-a-Complete-Piece-of-Data" class="headerlink" title="Parsing a Complete Piece of Data"></a>Parsing a Complete Piece of Data</h3><p>ReadRecord is used to read a complete piece of data from the log file.

Note that there’s a <code>resyncing_</code> here, which is set to true during initialization if there’s data to be skipped (initial_offset_&gt;0), indicating that it’s currently in a state of skipping data.

When we read files from disk, we <strong>use logical blocks as the minimum reading unit</strong>, read them into memory cache, and then parse the records one by one.

The exception handling here mainly uses the Reporter interface to record error information and then clear buffer_. This way, even if some exceptions occur during the reading process, it will at most affect the current buffer_ parsing without affecting the reading and parsing of subsequent logical blocks.</p><p>There’s another exception: <strong>when the current record is within the skipped initial_offset_ range</strong>. This is because when we skipped earlier, we only skipped entire logical blocks, ensuring reading starts from the <strong>head of the logical block</strong> containing initial_offset_. If the offset of the current record is less than initial_offset_, it means this record needs to be skipped. In this case, it adjusts the starting part of buffer_ and returns kBadRecord.</p><h2 id="WAL-Read-and-Write-Testing"><a href="#WAL-Read-and-Write-Testing" class="headerlink" title="WAL Read and Write Testing"></a>WAL Read and Write Testing</h2><p><a href="https://github.com/google/leveldb/blob/main/db/log_test.cc">db&#x2F;log_test.cc</a> provides some utility helper classes and functions, as well as detailed test cases, to fully test the WAL log reading and writing here. For example, BigString is used to generate strings of specified length, and the LogTest class encapsulates the read and write logic of Reader and Writer, exposing convenient interfaces for testing, such as Write, ShrinkSize, Read, etc. Additionally, it doesn’t directly read files but implements a StringSource class inheriting from SequentialFile, using string to simulate file reading. It also implements a StringDest class inheriting from WritableFile, using string to simulate file writing.</p><p>Here are some test cases for normal reading and writing:</p><ul><li>Empty: Tests reading an empty file directly, returning EOF.</li><li>ReadWrite: Tests simple writing and reading, ensuring that written data can be correctly read. Here, an empty string is written and can be normally read out.</li><li>ManyBlocks: Tests writing a large number of strings of different lengths, occupying multiple logical blocks. Then reads them one by one to ensure they can be correctly read.</li><li>Fragmentation: Tests writing extremely large strings, where each piece of data needs to occupy multiple records. Then reads them one by one to ensure they can be correctly read.</li></ul><p>In addition, some test cases for abnormal situations are constructed. For example, TruncatedTrailingRecordIsIgnored is used in LevelDB’s log system to verify the handling of <strong>truncated records at the end of log files</strong>. When the last record of a log file is not completely written (for example, due to system crash or other write interruption events), this incomplete record should be ignored rather than treated as an error.</p><figure class="highlight cpp"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="built_in">TEST_F</span>(LogTest, TruncatedTrailingRecordIsIgnored) &#123;</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="built_in">Write</span>(<span class="string">&quot;foo&quot;</span>);</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="built_in">ShrinkSize</span>(<span class="number">4</span>);  <span class="comment">// Drop all payload as well as a header byte</span></span><br><span class="line">  <span class="built_in">ASSERT_EQ</span>(<span class="string">&quot;EOF&quot;</span>, <span class="built_in">Read</span>());</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="comment">// Truncated last record is ignored, not treated as an error.</span></span><br><span class="line">  <span class="built_in">ASSERT_EQ</span>(<span class="number">0</span>, <span class="built_in">DroppedBytes</span>());</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="built_in">ASSERT_EQ</span>(<span class="string">&quot;&quot;</span>, <span class="built_in">ReportMessage</span>());</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>BadLength is used to verify the behavior when dealing with corrupted record length fields.

      <description>This article delves into the advanced C++ techniques used in LevelDB, including flexible arrays, symbol exporting for linking, and the Pimpl class design. Through specific code examples, it explains in detail how to implement variable-length data structures using flexible arrays, optimizing memory usage and reducing memory fragmentation. It also introduces different methods of symbol exporting and their importance for cross-platform compilation, as well as the application of the Pimpl design pattern in encapsulation and binary compatibility.</description>

This avoids allocating memory separately for the key data, thereby <strong>reducing additional memory allocation overhead and potential memory fragmentation issues</strong>. At the same time, the entire data structure of LRUHandle is compactly stored in a contiguous block of memory, improving space utilization and potentially enhancing cache locality. If std::vector or std::string were used instead, it would require two memory allocations for each LRUHandle object: one for the LRUHandle object itself, and one for the dynamically allocated memory by std::vector or std::string to store the data. In a high-performance database implementation, such memory allocation overhead is not negligible.</p><p>Furthermore, the array length at the end of the structure here is 1. In many other code examples, <strong>the trailing array length is 0 or not written at all</strong>. What’s the difference between these two methods? In fact, both approaches are used to add variable-length data at the end of a structure. <code>char key_data[];</code> is a more explicit way of declaring a trailing array, directly indicating that the array itself doesn’t allocate any space, introduced in the C99 standard. However, this declaration is not legal in some standard C++ versions, although some compilers may support it as an extension. In C++, to avoid compatibility issues, it’s usually recommended to use <code>char key_data[1];</code>, as it typically has better support in compilers.</p><p>There are some discussions about this that you can refer to: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14643406/whats-the-need-of-array-with-zero-elements">What’s the need of array with zero elements?</a> and <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4559558/one-element-array-in-struct">One element array in struct</a>.</p><h2 id="Symbol-Exporting-for-Linking"><a href="#Symbol-Exporting-for-Linking" class="headerlink" title="Symbol Exporting for Linking"></a>Symbol Exporting for Linking</h2><p>In many classes in include&#x2F;leveldb, such as the <a href="https://github.com/google/leveldb/blob/main/include/leveldb/db.h#L46">DB class</a> in <a href="https://github.com/google/leveldb/blob/main/include/leveldb/db.h">db.h</a>, the definition includes a macro <code>LEVELDB_EXPORT</code>, as follows:</p><figure class="highlight cpp"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">class</span> <span class="title class_">LEVELDB_EXPORT</span> DB &#123;</span><br><span class="line"> <span class="keyword">public</span>:</span><br><span class="line"> ...</span><br><span class="line">&#125;;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>The definition of this macro is in <a href="https://github.com/google/leveldb/blob/main/include/leveldb/export.h">include&#x2F;leveldb&#x2F;export.h</a>, with many compilation option branches.

To export leveldb as a dynamic link library, it’s necessary to control the visibility and linking attributes of symbols. To support cross-platform builds, different attributes are specified based on different platform information.</p><p>On Linux systems, when compiling the library, if LEVELDB_COMPILE_LIBRARY is defined, the <code>__attribute__((visibility(&quot;default&quot;)))</code> attribute will be added. This sets the linking visibility of the symbol to default, so that other code linking to this shared library can use this class.</p><p>What’s the problem if we don’t use this macro to export symbols? In the Linux environment, <strong>all symbols are visible by default</strong>, which will export more symbols. This not only increases the size of the library but may also conflict with symbols in other libraries. Hiding some symbols that are not intended for public use can help the linker optimize the program, <strong>improving loading speed and reducing memory usage</strong>. Moreover, through export macros, we can explicitly control which interfaces are public and which are private, <strong>hiding implementation details to achieve good encapsulation</strong>.</p><p>When <code>LEVELDB_SHARED_LIBRARY</code> is not defined, the LEVELDB_EXPORT macro <strong>is defined as empty</strong>, which means that when leveldb is compiled as a static library, all symbols that might otherwise need special export&#x2F;import markers don’t need such markers. In the case of static linking, symbol exporting is not necessary for the linking process because the code of the static library will be directly included in the final binary file during compilation.</p><h2 id="Pimpl-Class-Design"><a href="#Pimpl-Class-Design" class="headerlink" title="Pimpl Class Design"></a>Pimpl Class Design</h2><p>In many classes in LevelDB, there is only one private member variable of pointer type. For example, in the TableBuild class definition in the include&#x2F;leveldb&#x2F;table_builder.h header file, there is a private member variable Rep *rep_, which is a pointer to the Rep structure:</p><figure class="highlight cpp"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">private</span>:</span><br><span class="line"> <span class="keyword">struct</span> <span class="title class_">Rep</span>;</span><br><span class="line"> Rep* rep_;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>Then in the <a href="https://github.com/google/leveldb/blob/main/table/table_builder.cc">table&#x2F;table_builder.cc</a> file, the Rep structure is defined:</p><figure class="highlight cpp"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">struct</span> <span class="title class_">TableBuilder</span>::Rep &#123;</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="built_in">Rep</span>(<span class="type">const</span> Options&amp; opt, WritableFile* f)</span><br><span class="line">      : <span class="built_in">options</span>(opt),</span><br><span class="line">        <span class="built_in">index_block_options</span>(opt),</span><br><span class="line">        <span class="built_in">file</span>(f),</span><br><span class="line"><span class="comment">// ...</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p><strong>Why not directly define the Rep structure in the header file</strong>? In fact, this is using the <strong>Pimpl (Pointer to Implementation)</strong> design pattern, which has several advantages:</p><ul><li><strong>Binary compatibility</strong> (ABI stability). When the TableBuilder class library is updated, as long as its interface (.h file) remains unchanged, even if members are added to the Rep structure in the implementation or the implementation of the interface is changed, applications depending on this library <strong>only need to update the dynamic library file, without recompilation</strong>. If binary compatibility is not achieved, for example, if some member variables are added to a public class, and the application only updates the dynamic library without recompiling, it will cause the program to crash at runtime due to inconsistent object memory distribution. You can refer to a similar problem encountered in a previous business scenario, <a href="https://selfboot.cn/en/2024/03/15/object_memory_coredump/">Analysis of C++ Process Coredump Caused by Missing Bazel Dependencies</a>.</li><li><strong>Reduced compilation dependencies</strong>. If the definition of the Rep structure is in the header file, any modification to the Rep structure would cause files that include table_builder.h to be recompiled. By putting the definition of the Rep structure in the source file, only table_builder.cc needs to be recompiled.</li><li><strong>Separation of interface and implementation</strong>. The interface (public methods defined in the .h file) and the implementation (the Rep structure and specific implementation defined in the .cc file) are completely separate. This allows developers to freely modify implementation details, such as adding new private member variables or modifying internal logic, without changing the public interface.</li></ul><p><strong>Why do these advantages exist after using member pointers</strong>? This comes down to the memory layout of C++ objects. The layout of an object of a class in memory is contiguous and directly includes all of its non-static member variables. If the member variables are simple types (like int, double, etc.) or objects of other classes, these members will be directly embedded into the object’s memory layout. You can refer to my previous article <a href="https://selfboot.cn/en/2024/05/10/c++_object_model/">In-depth Understanding of C++ Object Memory Layout with Examples</a> for more information.</p><p>When a member variable is a pointer to another class, its layout in memory is just a pointer (Impl* pImpl), not the specific class object. The <strong>size and alignment of this pointer are fixed, regardless of what data Impl contains</strong>. Therefore, no matter how the internal implementation of the class corresponding to the pointer changes (e.g., adding or removing data members, changing the types of members, etc.), the size and layout of the external class remain unchanged and unaffected.</p><p>In “Effective C++”, Item 31 mentions using this approach to reduce compilation dependencies:</p><blockquote><p>If you can accomplish a task with object references or pointers, don’t use objects. You can define references and pointers to a type with just a type declaration; but if you define objects of a type, you need the type’s definition.</p></blockquote><p>Of course, there’s no silver bullet in software development, and these advantages come with corresponding costs. Refer to <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/pimpl">cppreference.com: PImpl</a>:</p><ul><li><strong>Lifecycle management overhead (Runtime Overhead)</strong>: Pimpl typically requires dynamically allocating memory on the heap to store the implementation object (Impl object). This dynamic allocation is <strong>slower than allocating objects on the stack</strong> (usually a faster allocation method) and involves more complex memory management. Additionally, allocating memory on the heap can cause memory leaks if not released. However, in the above example, Rep is allocated during object construction and released during destruction, so it won’t cause memory leaks.</li><li><strong>Access overhead</strong>: Each time a private member function or variable is accessed through Pimpl, it requires indirect access through a pointer.</li><li><strong>Space overhead</strong>: Each class using Pimpl will add at least one pointer’s worth of space overhead in its object to store the implementation pointer. If the implementation part needs to access public members, additional pointers may be needed or pointers may need to be passed as parameters.</li></ul><p>Overall, Pimpl is a good design pattern for basic libraries. You can also refer to <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8972588/is-the-pimpl-idiom-really-used-in-practice">Is the PIMPL idiom really used in practice?</a> for more discussion.</p><h2 id="Others"><a href="#Others" class="headerlink" title="Others"></a>Others</h2><h3 id="constexpr"><a href="#constexpr" class="headerlink" title="constexpr"></a>constexpr</h3><p><code>constexpr</code> specifies variables or functions used to declare constant expressions.

      <description>This article provides a detailed introduction to the basic concepts, mathematical principles, and parameter selection of Bloom filters. It analyzes the specific implementation in LevelDB&#39;s source code, including hash function selection, filter creation, and query processes. The article also showcases LevelDB&#39;s Bloom filter test cases, verifying its correctness and performance. Additionally, it offers a visual demonstration of Bloom filters to help readers intuitively understand their working principles.</description>
      
      
      
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In LevelDB, data is stored in SSTable files. When using Get() to query a key, it may be necessary to read multiple blocks from the SST file. To reduce disk reads, LevelDB provides a FilterPolicy strategy. If it can determine that a key is not in the current SSTable file, it can skip reading that file, thus improving query efficiency.</p><p>LevelDB supports user-defined filter policies but provides a default Bloom filter implementation. A Bloom filter is a space-efficient data structure used to determine whether an element is a member of a set. It has a certain false positive rate but no false negatives. In simple terms, <strong>if a Bloom filter determines that an element does not exist, then the element definitely does not exist; if a Bloom filter determines that an element exists, then the element may not exist</strong>.</p><span id="more"></span><p>Using a Bloom filter in LevelDB is quite simple, as shown in the following code:</p><figure class="highlight cpp"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">leveldb::Options options;</span><br><span class="line">options.filter_policy = <span class="built_in">NewBloomFilterPolicy</span>(<span class="number">10</span>);</span><br><span class="line">leveldb::DB* db;</span><br><span class="line">leveldb::DB::<span class="built_in">Open</span>(options, <span class="string">&quot;/tmp/testdb&quot;</span>, &amp;db);</span><br><span class="line"><span class="comment">// ... use the database ...</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">delete</span> db;</span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">delete</span> options.filter_policy;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>So what are the principles behind Bloom filters? And how are they implemented in LevelDB? Let’s take a look together in this article.</p><h2 id="LevelDB-Interface-Definition"><a href="#LevelDB-Interface-Definition" class="headerlink" title="LevelDB Interface Definition"></a>LevelDB Interface Definition</h2><p>Before delving into the implementation details of Bloom filters, let’s first look at how LevelDB defines the filter interface.</p><p>LevelDB <strong>defines the interface for filter policies</strong> in <a href="https://github.com/google/leveldb/blob/main/include/leveldb/filter_policy.h">filter_policy.h</a>. FilterPolicy itself is an abstract class that defines 3 pure virtual functions as interfaces. It cannot be instantiated directly and must be implemented by subclasses.</p><figure class="highlight cpp"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">class</span> <span class="title class_">LEVELDB_EXPORT</span> FilterPolicy &#123;</span><br><span class="line"> <span class="keyword">public</span>:</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="keyword">virtual</span> ~<span class="built_in">FilterPolicy</span>();</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">  <span class="function"><span class="keyword">virtual</span> <span class="type">const</span> <span class="type">char</span>* <span class="title">Name</span><span class="params">()</span> <span class="type">const</span> </span>= <span class="number">0</span>;</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">  <span class="function"><span class="keyword">virtual</span> <span class="type">void</span> <span class="title">CreateFilter</span><span class="params">(<span class="type">const</span> Slice* keys, <span class="type">int</span> n,</span></span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="params"><span class="function">                            std::string* dst)</span> <span class="type">const</span> </span>= <span class="number">0</span>;</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">  <span class="function"><span class="keyword">virtual</span> <span class="type">bool</span> <span class="title">KeyMayMatch</span><span class="params">(<span class="type">const</span> Slice&amp; key, <span class="type">const</span> Slice&amp; filter)</span> <span class="type">const</span> </span>= <span class="number">0</span>;</span><br><span class="line">&#125;;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>All three of these interfaces are important, and the code comments explain them in detail:</p><ul><li>Name(): Returns the name of the filter policy, which is <strong>very important for version compatibility</strong>. If the implementation of the filter policy (i.e., data structure or algorithm) changes, potentially causing incompatibility with old versions, the returned name should reflect this change to prevent old filter policies from being used incorrectly.</li><li>CreateFilter(): Used to create a filter, i.e., adding all keys in keys to the filter and then saving the content in dst.</li><li>KeyMayMatch(): Used to determine if a key exists in the filter, where filter is the dst generated by CreateFilter(). If the key exists in the filter, it must return true. <strong>If it doesn’t exist, it can return either true or false, but the probability of returning false should be as high as possible</strong>.</li></ul><p>Additionally, a factory function is provided to create a Bloom filter instance. However, one drawback is that after using the returned filter policy instance, you need to remember to manually release the resources. The use of a factory function here <strong>allows library maintainers to change the object creation process without affecting existing client code</strong>. For example, if a more efficient Bloom filter implementation is developed in the future, <strong>the factory function can simply be modified to return the new implementation without needing to modify the code that calls it. This provides convenience for future expansion and maintenance</strong>.</p><figure class="highlight cpp"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="function">LEVELDB_EXPORT <span class="type">const</span> FilterPolicy* <span class="title">NewBloomFilterPolicy</span><span class="params">(<span class="type">int</span> bits_per_key)</span></span>;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>By defining the filter policy interface and using a factory function, developers can easily implement different filter policies. To implement a new filter policy, you only need to inherit the <code>FilterPolicy</code> class and implement the corresponding methods. For the caller, they only need to pass the new filter policy to the <code>Options</code> object, and the overall changes will be relatively simple.</p><h2 id="Bloom-Filter-Principles"><a href="#Bloom-Filter-Principles" class="headerlink" title="Bloom Filter Principles"></a>Bloom Filter Principles</h2><p>LevelDB implemented its own Bloom filter as the default filter policy. Before we start looking at the implementation code, let’s first understand the principles of Bloom filters.</p><p>In 1970, Burton Howard Bloom created the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom_filter">Bloom filter</a>, an efficient data structure, to check whether an English word is in the dictionary for a spell checker. Its core is an m-bit bit array and k hash functions. The core operations are as follows:</p><ol><li>Initialization: At the start, the Bloom filter is an array of m bits, with each bit set to 0.</li><li>Adding elements: When adding an element to the Bloom filter, first use k hash functions to hash the element, producing k array position indices, then set all these positions to 1.</li><li>Querying elements: To check if an element is in the Bloom filter, use the same k hash functions to hash the element, obtaining k indices. If all these indices correspond to bits that are 1, then <strong>the element may exist in the set</strong>; if any bit is 0, then <strong>the element definitely does not exist in the set</strong>.</li></ol><p>From the above description, we can see that the time required to add or check whether an element is in the set is a fixed constant $ O( k )$, completely independent of the number of elements already in the set. Compared to other data structures representing sets, such as hash tables, balanced binary trees, skip lists, etc., in addition to fast lookup speed, Bloom filters are also very space-efficient as they don’t need to store the elements themselves, saving considerable space.</p><p>However, Bloom filters also have drawbacks. Careful consideration of the above process reveals that <strong>the query results of Bloom filters can be false positives</strong>. Bloom filters use multiple hash functions to process each element, setting multiple resulting positions to 1, <strong>and these positions may overlap with the hash results of other elements</strong>. Suppose a key does not exist in the set, but its hash results overlap with the hash results of other elements. In this case, the Bloom filter would determine that this key exists in the set, which is known as a false positive.</p><p>The probability that a Bloom filter incorrectly determines an element exists when it actually does not is called the false positive rate. Intuitively, <strong>for a fixed number k of hash functions, the larger the array size m, the fewer hash collisions, and thus the lower the false positive rate</strong>. To design a good Bloom filter ensuring a very low false positive rate, this qualitative analysis is not enough; we need to perform mathematical derivation for quantitative analysis.</p><h3 id="Mathematical-Derivation"><a href="#Mathematical-Derivation" class="headerlink" title="Mathematical Derivation"></a>Mathematical Derivation</h3><p>Here’s a simple derivation of the Bloom filter error rate calculation. You can skip this part and directly read the <a href="#LevelDB-Implementation">LevelDB Implementation</a> section. Assume the bit array size of the Bloom filter is $( m )$, the number of hash functions is $( k )$, and $( n )$ elements have been added to the filter. We assume that the hash functions we use are very random, so <strong>we can assume that the hash functions choose positions in the array with equal probability</strong>. During the insertion of elements, the probability of a certain bit being set to 1 by a certain hash function is $( \frac{1}{m} )$, and the probability of not being set to 1 is $( 1 - \frac{1}{m} )$.</p><p>$ k $ is the number of hash functions, and the hash functions we choose are uncorrelated and independent of each other. So the probability of <strong>a bit not being set to 1 by any hash function</strong> is:</p><p>$$ {\displaystyle \left(1-{\frac {1}{m}}\right)^{k}} $$</p><p>Next is a mathematical trick. The natural logarithm $ e $ has an identity:</p><p>$$ {\displaystyle \lim _{m\to \infty }\left(1-{\frac {1}{m}}\right)^{m}&#x3D;{\frac {1}{e}}} $$</p><p>For relatively large m, we can deduce:</p><p>$$ {\displaystyle \left(1-{\frac {1}{m}}\right)^{k}&#x3D;\left(\left(1-{\frac {1}{m}}\right)^{m}\right)^{k&#x2F;m}\approx e^{-k&#x2F;m}} $$</p><p>We have inserted n elements, so the probability of a certain bit not being set to 1 is:</p><p>$$ {\displaystyle \left(1-{\frac {1}{m}}\right)^{kn}\approx e^{-kn&#x2F;m}} $$</p><p>Therefore, the probability of a certain bit being set to 1 is:</p><p>$$ {\displaystyle 1-\left(1-{\frac {1}{m}}\right)^{kn}\approx 1-e^{-kn&#x2F;m}} $$</p><p>Assuming an element is not in the set, the probability that all k bits are set to 1 is:</p><p>$$ {\displaystyle \left(1-e^{-kn&#x2F;m}\right)^{k}} $$</p><h3 id="Parameter-Selection"><a href="#Parameter-Selection" class="headerlink" title="Parameter Selection"></a>Parameter Selection</h3><p>From the above derivation, we can see that the false positive rate is related to the number of hash functions $ k $, the size of the bit array $ m $, and the number of added elements $ n $.</p><ul><li>$ n $ is usually determined by the application scenario, representing the <strong>expected total number of elements to be inserted into the Bloom filter</strong>. It can be predicted, determined by external factors, and is not easily adjustable.</li><li>Increasing $ m $ can directly reduce the false positive rate, but this will <strong>increase the storage space requirements of the Bloom filter</strong>. In storage-constrained environments, you may not want to increase it indefinitely. Additionally, the effect of expanding $ m $ is <strong>linear</strong>, and you need to balance performance improvement with additional storage costs.</li><li>Changing $ k $ has a <strong>very significant impact on the false positive rate</strong> because it directly affects the probability of bits in the bit array being set to 1.</li></ul><p>Considering all these factors, in practical applications, $ n $ is determined by the usage scenario, while $ m $ is limited by storage costs, making adjusting $ k $ a practical and direct optimization method. Given the expected number of elements $n$ and the bit array size $m$, <strong>we need to find an appropriate k that minimizes the false positive rate</strong>.</p><p>Finding the appropriate k here is an optimization problem that can be solved mathematically. It’s quite complex, so we’ll just state the conclusion. The optimal $(k)$ is as follows:</p><p>$$ k &#x3D; \frac{m}{n} \ln 2 $$</p><h2 id="LevelDB-Implementation"><a href="#LevelDB-Implementation" class="headerlink" title="LevelDB Implementation"></a>LevelDB Implementation</h2><p>Above, we introduced the principles of Bloom filters. Now let’s see how they are specifically implemented in LevelDB. The implementation of Bloom filters in LevelDB is in <a href="https://github.com/google/leveldb/blob/main/util/bloom.cc">bloom.cc</a>, where BloomFilterPolicy inherits from FilterPolicy and implements the aforementioned interfaces.</p><h3 id="Hash-Function-Count-Selection"><a href="#Hash-Function-Count-Selection" class="headerlink" title="Hash Function Count Selection"></a>Hash Function Count Selection</h3><p>First, let’s look at the selection of the number of hash functions k.

This value represents the <strong>average number of bits occupied by each key</strong>, i.e., $ \frac{m}{n} $. The 0.69 here is an approximation of $ \ln (2) $, and this coefficient comes from the optimal hash function count formula $ k &#x3D; \frac{m}{n} \ln 2 $ discussed above. Finally, some boundary protection is performed here to ensure that the value of k is between 1 and 30, avoiding k being too large and making hash calculations too time-consuming.</p><h3 id="Creating-the-Filter"><a href="#Creating-the-Filter" class="headerlink" title="Creating the Filter"></a>Creating the Filter</h3><p>Next, let’s see how the filter is created here.

It also considers some boundary conditions: if the resulting number of bits is too small (less than 64 bits), it sets it to 64 bits to avoid a high false positive rate. Additionally, it considers byte alignment, converting the number of bits to bytes while ensuring the total number of bits is a multiple of 8.</p><p>Next, it uses resize to increase the size of dst, <strong>allocating space for the bit array after the target string</strong>. Here, the Bloom filter <strong>is designed to be appended to existing data without overwriting or deleting existing data</strong>. The newly added space is initialized to 0 because the Bloom filter’s bit array needs to start from an all-zero state. Then k_, the number of hash functions, is added to the end of the target string dst. This value is part of the Bloom filter’s metadata and is used to determine how many hash calculations need to be performed when querying whether a key exists.</p><p>Finally, there’s the core part of the Bloom filter, calculating which bit array positions need to be set to 1. Normally, you would need to set up <strong>k hash functions, calculate k times, and then set the corresponding positions</strong>. However, LevelDB’s implementation seems different. For each key, it uses the BloomHash function to calculate the initial hash value h of the key, then sets the corresponding position. In subsequent calculations, each time it right-shifts the previous hash value by 17 bits, left-shifts by 15 bits, and then performs an OR operation to calculate delta. Then it adds delta to the previous hash value to calculate the next hash value. This way, it can obtain k hash values and then set the corresponding positions.</p><p>In the previous <a href="#Mathematical-Derivation">Mathematical Derivation</a> section, we mentioned that these <strong>k hash functions need to be random and mutually independent</strong>. Can the above method meet this requirement? The code comment mentions that it adopts the <strong>double-hashing</strong> method, referring to the analysis in <a href="https://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~michaelm/postscripts/tr-02-05.pdf">[Kirsch,Mitzenmacher 2006]</a>. Although the hash values generated by double hashing are not as completely unrelated as those from completely independent hash functions, in practical applications, they provide sufficient randomness and independence to meet the requirements of Bloom filters.</p><p>The advantages here are also obvious. Double hashing can generate multiple pseudo-independent hash values from one basic hash function, without needing to implement k hashes, making the implementation very simple. Moreover, compared to multiple independent hash functions, <strong>the double hashing method reduces computational overhead because it only needs to calculate one real hash value, with the rest of the hash values obtained through simple arithmetic and bit operations</strong>.</p><h3 id="Querying-Key-Existence"><a href="#Querying-Key-Existence" class="headerlink" title="Querying Key Existence"></a>Querying Key Existence</h3><p>Finally, let’s look at how to query whether a key exists.

If the filter length is less than 2, it returns false. It reads the value of k from the last byte of the filter data, which was stored when creating the filter and is used to determine how many hash calculations need to be performed. If k is greater than 30, this case is considered as possibly for future new encoding schemes, so the function directly returns true, assuming the key might exist in the set (as of 2024, no new encoding schemes have been extended here).</p><p>The next part is similar to when creating the filter. It uses the BloomHash function to calculate the hash value of the key, then performs bit rotation to generate delta, which is used to modify the hash value in the loop to simulate the effect of multiple hash functions. During this process, if any bit is 0, it indicates that <strong>the key is definitely not in the set</strong>, and the function returns false. If all relevant bits are 1, it returns true, indicating that <strong>the key might be in the set</strong>.</p><h2 id="Bloom-Filter-Testing"><a href="#Bloom-Filter-Testing" class="headerlink" title="Bloom Filter Testing"></a>Bloom Filter Testing</h2><p>The implementation of Bloom filters in LevelDB also provides complete test code, which can be found in <a href="https://github.com/google/leveldb/blob/main/util/bloom_test.cc">bloom_test.cc</a>.</p><p>First, the BloomTest class is derived from the testing::Test class, used to organize and execute test cases related to Bloom filters. Its constructor and destructor are used to create and release instances of NewBloomFilterPolicy, ensuring that each test case can run in a clean environment. The Add method is used to add keys to the Bloom filter, and Build converts the collected keys into a filter. The Matches method is used to check whether a specific key matches the filter, while the FalsePositiveRate method is used to <strong>evaluate the false positive rate of the filter</strong>.</p><p>Then there’s a series of specific test cases defined by the TEST_F macro, allowing each test case to automatically possess the methods and properties defined in the BloomTest class. The first two test cases are relatively simple:</p><ul><li>EmptyFilter: Tests an empty filter, i.e., whether the filter can correctly determine that a key does not exist when no keys have been added.</li><li>Small: Tests the case of adding a small number of keys, checking whether the filter can correctly determine if keys exist.</li></ul><p>It’s worth noting the VaryingLengths test case, which is a more complex test case used to evaluate and verify <strong>the performance and efficiency of the Bloom filter under different data scales (i.e., different numbers of keys)</strong>. By using the defined NextLength function to incrementally increase the number of keys, it tests the performance of the Bloom filter under different key set sizes. It mainly tests the following three aspects:</p><ol><li>Ensures that the size of the constructed Bloom filter is within the expected range;</li><li>Ensures that all keys added to the filter can be correctly identified as existing;</li><li>Evaluates the false positive rate (false positive rate) of the Bloom filter at different lengths, ensuring that the false positive rate does not exceed 2%. At the same time, it categorizes filters as “good” or “mediocre” based on their false positive rates, and performs statistics and comparisons on their numbers, ensuring that the number of “mediocre” filters is not too high.</li></ol><p>The complete test code is as follows:</p><figure class="highlight cpp"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br><span class="line">12</span><br><span class="line">13</span><br><span class="line">14</span><br><span class="line">15</span><br><span class="line">16</span><br><span class="line">17</span><br><span class="line">18</span><br><span class="line">19</span><br><span class="line">20</span><br><span class="line">21</span><br><span class="line">22</span><br><span class="line">23</span><br><span class="line">24</span><br><span class="line">25</span><br><span class="line">26</span><br><span class="line">27</span><br><span class="line">28</span><br><span class="line">29</span><br><span class="line">30</span><br><span class="line">31</span><br><span class="line">32</span><br><span class="line">33</span><br><span class="line">34</span><br><span class="line">35</span><br><span class="line">36</span><br><span class="line">37</span><br><span class="line">38</span><br><span class="line">39</span><br><span class="line">40</span><br><span class="line">41</span><br><span class="line">42</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">  <span class="built_in">TEST_F</span>(BloomTest, VaryingLengths) &#123;</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="type">char</span> buffer[<span class="built_in">sizeof</span>(<span class="type">int</span>)];</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">  <span class="comment">// Count number of filters that significantly exceed the false positive rate</span></span><br><span class="line">  <span class="type">int</span> mediocre_filters = <span class="number">0</span>;</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="type">int</span> good_filters = <span class="number">0</span>;</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">  <span class="keyword">for</span> (<span class="type">int</span> length = <span class="number">1</span>;

It will then automatically adjust the bit array. After that, you can add elements and check if elements are in the Bloom filter. If an element is present, the corresponding array bits will be displayed with black boxes. If it’s not present, the corresponding array bits will be displayed with red boxes. This allows for an intuitive understanding of how Bloom filters work.</p><p>Also, for ease of demonstration, clicking on a bit group will show which keys would hash to this location. In reality, Bloom filters don’t store this information; it’s stored additionally here just for demonstration purposes.</p><h2 id="Summary"><a href="#Summary" class="headerlink" title="Summary"></a>Summary</h2><p>Bloom filters are an efficient data structure used to determine whether an element exists in a set. Its core is a bit array and multiple hash functions, using multiple hash calculations to set bits in the bit array. Through rigorous mathematical derivation, we can conclude that the false positive rate of Bloom filters is related to the number of hash functions, the size of the bit array, and the number of added elements. In practical applications, the false positive rate can be optimized by adjusting the number of hash functions.</p><p>LevelDB implemented a Bloom filter as the default filter policy, which can be created through a factory function, maintaining extensibility. To save hash resource consumption, LevelDB generates multiple pseudo-independent hash values through the double hashing method, then sets the corresponding bits. When querying, it also uses multiple hash calculations to determine whether a key exists in the set. LevelDB provides complete test cases to verify the correctness and false positive rate of the Bloom filter.</p><p>Additionally, to intuitively understand how Bloom filters work, I’ve created a visualization demonstration of Bloom filters here, showing the principles of Bloom filters through charts.</p>]]></content:encoded>
